<p>Ever wondered what to do in an emergency? Would you know how to treat a family member or friend if they had an accident? In the few precious moments before help arrives, could you save a life?<br>
  <br>
  Alarmingly, statistics show that while we all think about learning first aid, a small percentage of the population take the time.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/a_parasol.png" width="22" height="22"> In excess of 30,000 Australians every year die from sudden Cardiac Arrest - making this Australia’s leading cause of death.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/a_parasol.png" width="22" height="22"> Drowning is the single most common cause of death of young children, aged 1 to 4 years of age, with half of these deaths occurring in swimming pools or spas.<br>
  <br>
  Don’t be a statistic, this AppBook is an easy to follow guide to how to treat a range of medical emergencies.<br>
  <br>
  'Australian First Aid' for the iPad (based on our 'Active First Aid' book) is a quick and easy reference to any emergency that may occur in the home or outdoors.<br>
  <br>
  Every home in Australia should have a copy of this book in their bookcase and motor vehicle. Over 350,000 copies of the book version have been sold to date, making 'Active First Aid' one of the country’s leading publications.<br>
  <br>
  The author, Peter McKie is highly acclaimed in Australia and overseas as a medical emergency treatment specialist. His expertise is sought by many of Australia’s leading industry bodies.<br>
  <br>
  This AppBook is no substitute for undertaking a Nationally Accredited First Aid course with an approved provider, and I would encourage you to obtain training.<br>
  <br>
  I hope that you find this AppBook a valuable resource.<br>
