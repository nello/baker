  </span>
  <p>The information in this chapter is a guide only. It is provided to help first aiders understand the potential legal consequences of becoming involved in an incident. You should seek your own independent legal advice if you have any specific questions about legal issues associated with first aid procedures or become involved in legal action.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/legal_1.png" width="214" height="214" class="floatright">There are four main legal considerations relating to first aid:<br>
    </span><br>
    <img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> Duty of Care <br>
    <img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> Negligence <br>
    <img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> Consent <br>
    <img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> Recording<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bluebold">Duty of care<br>
    </span><br>
    &quot;Duty of care&quot; describes the legal duty owed by one person to another to act in a certain way. As a first aider, you have a duty of care towards your casualties to exercise reasonable care and skill in providing first aid treatment. The duty arises because you have knowledge and skills relevant to a medical emergency situation.<br>
    <br>
    If you choose to provide first aid assistance, you have a duty to use your knowledge and skills in a responsible way.<br>
    <br>
    The common law does not impose an automatic duty on first aiders to go to the aid of every casualty they come across. However, first aiders do have a duty to provide first aid assistance if they have voluntarily taken on that role. For example, a nominated first aid officer in a workplace owes a duty of care to assist another person in that workplace.<br>
    <br>
    Legislation can also impose a duty of care. For instance, legislation in some States says that staff in child care centres must provide medical aid to a child who becomes ill or is injured. Further, in the Northern Territory, the Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence, for a person who is able to do so, to 'callously fail' to provide first aid to a person urgently in need and whose life may be endangered. The penalty is up to seven years imprisonment.<br>
    <br>
    Once you start first aid treatment of a casualty you do take on a duty of care to provide first aid with reasonable skill and care and ensure your actions do not increase the risk to the casualty. You should continue to provide first aid once this treatment has begun, until:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> The scene becomes unsafe <br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Another trained first aider arrives and takes over <br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Qualified help arrives and takes over <br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> The casualty shows signs of recovery <br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> You become physically unable to continue<br>
    <br>
    Various Australian States and Territories (excluding Queensland and Tasmania) exclude from liability a person where, in an emergency, they help a person who is, or risks being, injured. Such protection from civil liability for an act or omission exists as long as:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> The person rendering assistance does so in good faith (that is, acting honestly, without fraud, collusion, or participation in any wrongdoing);<br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> The person's action was without expectation of reward or payment;<br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> The person was not responsible for the injury in relation to which the assistance was provided;<br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> The person's capacity to exercise reasonable care and skill was not significantly impaired by being under the influence of alcohol or drugs;<br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> The person exercises reasonable care and skill; and<br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> The person does not impersonate a health care or emergency services worker or a police officer or otherwise falsely represents that he or she has skills or expertise in connection with the rendering of emergency assistance.<br>
    <br>
    In addition, each Australian jurisdiction has legislation which provides protection for volunteers of charitable, religious, educational and benevolent community organisations. Such volunteers are protected from civil liability for acts or omissions made or done in good faith within the scope of the activities organised by the community organisation.<br>
    <br>
    The protection does not extend to damage caused by the volunteer's criminal conduct or impairment of the volunteer's ability by alcohol or drugs.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bluebold">Negligence<br>
    </span><br>
    In the unlikely event that a first aider is sued in connection with providing first aid assistance, the courts would look at the circumstances surrounding the event to see if the first aider acted negligently in the way the first aid was provided. The following factors must all be present for a first aider to be found negligent:<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bodybold">1.</span> A duty of care existed between the first aider and the casualty;<br>
    <span class="bodybold">2.</span> The first aider did not exercise reasonable care and skill in providing the first aid;<br>
    <span class="bodybold">3.</span> Breached the relevant standard of care; and<br>
    <span class="bodybold">4.</span> The casualty sustained damage as a result of an act or omission of the first aider.<br>
    <br>
    A first aider is not considered a 'professional' in most cases. A court would look at the first aider's training and at what a prudent and reasonable person would have done with the same level of training in the same circumstances.<br>
    <br>
    Because encouraging people to assist others is in the public interest, it is likely that the Australian courts would only see first aiders as liable if it can be shown that their behaviour was grossly negligent and would take account of all the circumstances of the event.<br>
    <br>
    The court may examine issues to establish whether the first aider exercised reasonable care, such as:<br>
    <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> What was the first aiderâ€™s level of knowledge?<br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Did the first aider perform within their skill levels?<br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> What information was available for the first aider, including:<br>
    <img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> Was adequate questioning used? <br>
    <img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> Was a thorough examination of the casualty undertaken?<br>
    <img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> Were all the facts available taken into account?<br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Were accepted first aid procedures complied with?<br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> What were the circumstances in which the first aider provided assistance?<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bodybold">  Example:<br>
    </span><br>
    A first aider gives CPR to a casualty in cardiac arrest. During this CPR a rib is broken. The resuscitation is successful and after the event the casualty decides to sue for the rib injury.<br>
    <span class="bodybold"><br>
    The court would look at the facts and may decide that:</span><br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> It is reasonable to expect that a first aider might break a casualty's rib while delivering CPR to save the casualty's life; and<br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> The first aider acted with reasonable care and skill; and<br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> The first aider was not negligent in providing CPR in this way; and<br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> The outcome for the casualty of not performing CPR could have been far worse than suffering a broken rib.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bluebold">  Consent<br>
    </span><br>
    Before you start treating a casualty you should ask for and receive the casualty's consent to your treatment. If the casualty is unconscious, or is unable to give consent due to their injuries, you can assume consent and start treatment. If the casualty is under 18 years old, then you should seek consent from a parent or guardian. If a parent or guardian is not present, you can start treatment.<br>
    <br>
    You should not start treatment if an adult, who seems of sound mind and able to make a decision, refuses your offer of treatment.<br>
    <br>
    You only have the casualty's consent to treat them for a condition that affects their immediate health. You should not provide help for any ailment that goes beyond your knowledge of first aid.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bluebold">Recording<br>
    </span><br>
    First aiders should always make notes or fill out a casualty report on any event attended, no matter how minor. Proper records will help you to recall the incident if you are ever asked about it at a later stage.<br>
    <br>
    The responsibility is greater if you have a role as a first aider in your workplace, and you may have reporting obligations under your State or Territory occupational health and safety (OHS) legislation. You can check this with your workplace OHS representative.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/legal_3.jpg" width="212" height="141" class="floatleft">Records may be used in a court, so ensure that your reports or notes are legible, accurate, factual, contain all relevant information, and are based on observations rather than opinions.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bodybold">When preparing a report some general guidelines should be followed:</span><br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Use ink only.<br>
    <img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Any corrections should be crossed out with a single line and initialled. Do not use correction fluid to correct any mistakes.<br>
    <img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Sign and date the record. <br>
    <img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> The information should be kept confidential, and should only be accessed by authorised people. Who is authorised to access the records varies in different State or Territories.<br>
    <img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> In a workplace incident, a copy should go to authorised employer representatives for auditing and OH&amp;S monitoring purposes.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bluebold">Documenting your treatment<br>
    </span><br>
    The accurate recording of injury/illness is also of great assistance to any medical personnel who take over your casualty's treatment, such as ambulance officers. The format that is used to report injury and illness varies from workplace to workplace, and from State to State due to different policy requirements or legislation.<br>
  <br>
  The information which should be contained in an injury/illness report is:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> The date and time of incident <br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> Brief personal details (name, address, date of birth) <br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> History of the illness/injury <br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> Observations (signs, symptoms and vital signs)<br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> The first aider's assessment of the injury/illness<br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> Date <br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> Signature of first aider<br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> The date of report <br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> Print name and title of first aider<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/legal_4.jpg" width="318" height="180" class="floatright">Copies of reports should be given to:</span><br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> The person taking over care<br>
    <img src="images/a_tick_sq.png" width="22" height="22"> The casualty <br>
    <br>
    The first aider keeps a copy as a record which is to be kept secure.<br>
    <span class="blue"><img src="images/infos.png" width="40" height="40" class="info"><br>
    The confidentiality of all records must be maintained</span><span class="bluebold"><br>
    </span><br>
    A copy of the report should be sent with the casualty to the hospital or medical facility.<br>
    <br>
