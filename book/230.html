  <p><img src="images/hygiene_1.png" width="190" height="150" class="floatright">Ensuring cleanliness in all first aid situations is extremely important. A first aider must take precautions to ensure that the risk of infection is minimised by practising good first aid hygiene procedures. <br>
    <br>
      Infectious diseases are those diseases which cause infections to the human body, and in some cases are transmitted by contact or by cross-infection.<br>
    <br>
      Infection may be due to bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="images/hygiene_2.png" width="600" height="405" class="floatcenter"><br>
    <br>
      The usual methods of communication are: <span class="bodybold">direct contact</span> (with an infected person); <span class="bodybold">indirect contact</span> (through coughing, air conditioning, or similar); or <span class="bodybold">through a host</span> (insects, worms).<br>
    <br>
      Many deadly infectious diseases have been eradicated, but several, such as poliomyelitis (a virus), are again on the increase. Many are preventable by immunisation. Some, such as the <span class="bodyitalic">Human Immunodeficiency Virus</span> (HIV), have no cure or immunisation as yet. Examples of infectious diseases are:<br>
    <br>
      <span class="bodybold">Viral Infections</span>. <span class="bodyitalic">Measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis, influenza, chickenpox, HIV and the common cold.</span><br>
    <br>
      <span class="bodybold">Bacterial Infections</span>. <span class="bodyitalic">Throat infections, whooping cough, diphtheria, rheumatic fever, tuberculosis strains, cholera, staphylococcus infection and some forms of meningitis.</span><br>
    <br>
      <img src="images/hygiene_3.png" width="200" height="134" class="floatright"><span class="bodybold">Parasitic Infections</span>. <span class="bodyitalic">Malaria, tapeworm, hookworm, itch mites, pubic and body lice.</span><br>
    <br>
      <span class="bodybold">Fungal Infections</span>. <span class="bodyitalic">Ringworm, tinea ('Athlete's Foot') and thrush.<br>
    </span><br>
      The human body has natural defences against infection and remains immune to certain types. Immunity usually comes from surviving previous exposure with resultant antibodies being produced. The blood contains leucocytes (white blood cells), which help produce antibodies. The leucocytes and antibodies [try to] combat any infection which invades the body. Unfortunately, while the body responds quickly to infection, the initial defences can be overwhelmed if the infectious agent is numerous. When this happens the casualty develops the disease.<br>
    <br>
      It is at this stage that the body requires help in the form of medically prescribed antibiotics or similar drugs.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bluebold"> General precautions<br>
    </span><br>
      While there is little that the first aider can do to cure an infection there is a great deal that you can do to limit the risk of infection and treat the symptoms of minor infections. However, the first aid provider should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of the common diseases, and advise the infected person to seek appropriate medical attention.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bodybold">Advice that the first aid provider can offer is:<br>
    </span><br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> care of the susceptible, ie. the ill, the elderly, and the very young<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> care in nutrition and preparation of food<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> maintenance of personal hygiene <br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> maintenance of sanitary standards <br>
      <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> avoid direct contact with infection <br>
      <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> avoid transmitting infection<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bluebold">First aid hygiene<br>
    </span><br>
      <img src="images/hygiene_4.jpg" width="250" height="235" class="floatright">It is important that first aid procedures have due regard for the danger of cross- infection. Simple rules of personal hygiene and wearing gloves are sufficient to guard both the first aid provider and the casualty from contamination when treating or caring for a casualty.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="headred"><span class="headreditalic">PRIOR TO TREATMENT</span></span><br>
    <br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> wash hands with soap and water, or rinse with antiseptic<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> ensure that hands are washed thoroughly between fingers and under nails<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> place a barrier between you and the casualty's body fluids<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> always wear nitrile or latex gloves if available<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> take care not to touch any unclean object when wearing gloves or once hands are washed<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if possible, use a protective cover over clothing<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> cover any adjacent areas likely to produce infection<br>
      <br>
      <span class="headred"><span class="headreditalic">DURING TREATMENT</span></span><br>
<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> use a face shield or mask with a one-way-valve or filter, if available, when performing resuscitation<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> use only clean bandages and dressings<br>
      <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> avoid coughing, breathing, or speaking over the wound<br>
      <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> avoid contact with body fluids <br>
      <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> avoid treating more than one casualty without washing hands and changing gloves<br>
    <br>
    <span class="headred"><span class="headreditalic">AFTER TREATMENT</span><br>
    </span><br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> clean up both casualty and yourself <br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> clean up the immediate vicinity <br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> dispose of dressings, bandages, sharps, gloves and soiled clothing safely and correctly<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> wash hands with soap and water thoroughly, even if gloves were used<br>
    <br>
      Waste materials can be placed inside a plastic bag, which is then placed inside another plastic bag and tied securely. Use a biohazard bag if possible. Do not place in rubbish bin. Seek advice from your local health department on disposal options.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="bluebold">Needle-Stick Injuries<br>
    </span><br>
      The principal risk associated with needle stick injury is contracting blood borne viruses such as HIV (AIDS) and HBV (Hepatitis B).<br>
<br>
      There is a low risk of a person who is pricked or scratched by a discarded needle being infected with AIDS, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.<br>
    <br>
      The most common sharps injuries are from needle-sticks, typically on the index finger and thumb. Needle-stick injuries account for up to 80% of all accidental exposures to blood.<br>
    <br>
      Ways of reducing the risk of needlestick injuries include:<br>
    <br>
      <img src="images/hygiene_5.jpg" width="285" height="421" class="floatright"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> It is generally recommended that workers who may come in contact with blood or body fluids should receive Hepatitis B vaccinations<br>
      <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Follow all safety procedures in the workplace<br>
      <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Latex or nitrile gloves will not protect you against needlestick injuries<br>
      <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Never bend or snap used needles <br>
      <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Never re-cap a needle <br>
      <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Always place used needles into a clearly labelled and puncture-proof sharps approved container<br>
    <img src="images/cross.png" width="44" height="44" class="cross"><br>
    <span class="headred">Care and Treatment</span><br>
    <br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> wash away the blood or body fluid with soap and water<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if the eyes are contaminated, rinse eyes while open with water or saline<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if blood gets into the mouth, spit it out and then repeatedly rinse with water<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> refer the person immediately to a doctor or hospital emergency department who will assess the risk of transmission and discuss options for testing and treatment<br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> ensure the safe disposal of the sharp <br>
      <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> report the incident immediately<br>
    <br>
  <span class="bluebold"><span class="redbold"><img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> Dispose of waste in accordance with the requirements of the relevant local, State, Territory or Commonwealth authorities. </span></span></p>
