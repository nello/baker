Accurate casualty treatment, and later medical treatment, depends on accurate and detailed information from the incident scene.<br>
<br>
At an incident it is important that you note as much information as you can. Details such as the estimated speed at which a car was moving, the way it hit an object, the size and shape of that object and whether the casualty was conscious or unconscious when you arrived. <br>
<br>
Note all this and report it to the ambulance personnel or doctor. These are important details for emergency personnel trying to evaluate the casualty's injuries. You must approach the incident in a confident and methodical way. This not only allows you to gain information, but also presents you as someone who knows what they are doing. This attitude imparts confidence to the casualty and bystanders. <br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold"><img src="images/examining_3.jpg" width="265" height="132" class="floatright">The approach <br>
</span><br>
Take the time to look at the scene for anything that may threaten your safety or the safety of those on or around the scene.<br>
<br>
Look for the number of casualties involved. Look for bystanders who may be able to supply information on what happened and the number of casualties.<br>
<br>
What are your impressions as you approach the incident? <br>
<br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Is it a road traffic accident? <br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Has a person fallen from a ladder?
<p>Quickly confirm in your mind just what is present; bystanders, other vehicles, power lines, power cables, or collapsed structures. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">Primary examination <br>
  </span><br>
  Check to see if the casualty is conscious. If unconscious treat as per the Emergency Action Plan. <br>
  <br>
  Check to see if there is severe life threatening bleeding and control immediately. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">Try to obtain a history from: <br>
  </span><br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> The casualty <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Bystanders</p>
<p>At this point you are able to decide what approach and treatment is appropriate. <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><br>
    If the casualty is conscious ask three important questions: </span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">1.</span> What happened? <br>
  <span class="bodybold">2.</span> Where does it hurt the most? <br>
  <span class="bodybold">3.</span> Can you take a deep breath? </p>
<p>These three questions will give you information from the casualty, including whether the casualty remembers the incident (were they unconscious), what injury hurts the most, and if any chest injuries may be affecting breathing. <br>
  <br>
  Pay attention to: History – the incident (<span class="bodybold">SAMPLE</span>) <br>
  <br>

  <span class="bodybold"> Symptoms –</span> what the casualty tells you <br>

  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Pain, blurred vision, nausea </p>
<p><span class="bluebold"><img src="images/examining_1.jpg" width="282" height="184" class="floatright">Observations <br>
  </span><br>
  One of the most important things a first aider can do is to take and record accurate observations. There are four vital observations that should be, if at all possible, written down against the time and the name of the casualty. These observations are: <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Skin appearance <br>
  <img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Conscious state <br>
  <img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Pulse <br>
  <img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Respiration </p>
<p>The first set of these observations, once taken and recorded,becomes the 'baseline observations'. All changes in the casualty's observations are measured against this baseline for improvement or worsening of their condition. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="greenbold">Skin Appearance</span><br>
  <br>
  The appearance of the skin can be a good indicator of the casualty's condition. Check colour, condition and temperature of the skin. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">Colour –</span> check the colour of skin in the mouth and lips. Red, pink, pale or blue. </p>
<p>(Checking the lining of the mouth and lips allows a quick assessment of casualties from all ethnic backgrounds). <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">Temperature –</span> is the skin warm or cool to touch? <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">Condition –</span> is the skin dry or wet? <br>
  <br>
  <span class="greenbold">Conscious State</span><br>
  <br>
  Check the casualty for a response by touching the casualty on the shoulders and asking loudly </span><span class="bodybolditalic">'are you all right'?</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">Note the following: </span><br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Is the casualty alert and aware of time and place? <br>
  <img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Is the casualty confused, violent or agitated? <br>
  <img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Is the casualty roused by touch or pain? </p>
<p>There are 4 levels of consciousness (<span class="bodybold">AVPU</span>). <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">1.</span> <span class="bodyboldUline">A</span>lert – the casualty is responsive and alert and aware of time and place. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">2.</span> Responsive to <span class="bodyboldUline">V</span>erbal stimulus – the casualty is not aware of time and place. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">3.</span> The casualty responds only to <span class="bodyboldUline">P</span>ainful stimuli. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">4.</span> <span class="bodyboldUline">U</span>nresponsive – the casualty does not respond to stimuli. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="greenbold">Pulse</span><br>
  <br>
  The pulse can be difficult to find and <span class="bodybolditalic">should only be used</span> when time permits and when assessing a casualty that is breathing. <span class="bodybold">DO NOT</span> use a pulse to determine if resuscitation is required. <br>
  <br>
  The neck is the best location to check for a pulse, which is called the carotid. The carotid is the strongest and most easily accessible of all the pulse points. The radial pulse (wrist) is often the easiest to find. When taking a pulse, note how fast the pulse rate is over one minute. A normal adult will have a pulse rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. Children and babies have a faster heart rate than adults. Note the rate, rhythm and strength of the pulse. <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> <span class="bodybold">Rate –</span> How many beats per minute? Count for 15 seconds and multiply by 4 <br>
  <img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> Adults – 60 to 100 beats per minute <br>
  <img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> Children – 90 to 130 beats per minute <br>
  <img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> Infants – 120 to 160 beats per minute <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Rhythm –</span> Is the pulse regular or irregular? <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Strength –</span> Is the pulse strong or weak? </p>
<p><span class="greenbold">Respiration<br>
  </span><br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Rate –</span> How many breaths per minute? Count for 15 seconds and multiply by 4 <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Rhythm –</span> Is the breathing regular or irregular? <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_note.png" width="22" height="22"> Sounds –</span> Is there gasping, gurgling, wheezing or snoring? <br>
  <br>
  <span class="greenbold"><img src="images/examining_2.jpg" width="334" height="500" class="floatright">Pain<br>
  </span><br>
  Pain can be one of the most difficult observations to make as every person has a different <span class="bodyitalic">'pain threshold'</span>. Ask <span class="bodybold">open questions</span> such as <span class="bodyitalic">&quot;can you describe your pain to me&quot;,</span> not <span class="bodyitalic">&quot;does your pain feel sharp&quot;. </span><br>
  <br>
  As pain is subjective the first aider needs to use a tool such as the <span class="bodybold">PQRST </span>of pain. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodyboldUline">P</span>rovocation – What brought the pain on? Did the pain start when the casualty was at rest or did it start with activity or injury? <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodyboldUline">Q</span>uality – How is the pain described? Is it intermittent, sharp, dull, heavy, burning or an ache? <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodyboldUline">R</span>egion/Radiation – Where is the pain situated, and does it travel to other areas of the body? <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodyboldUline">S</span>everity – Measure the pain on a scale of 1 to 10. A rating of 10 on this scale would be severe pain. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodyboldUline">T</span>ime – How long ago did the pain start? <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">Secondary examination <br>
  </span><br>
  Now that you know the casualty's basic observations and condition you have more time to thoroughly examine a conscious casualty by systematically Looking and Feeling (<span class="bodybold">LAF</span>). <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> <span class="bodyboldUline">L</span>ook for deformity, wounds and swelling <br>

    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> <span class="bodyboldUline">F</span>eel for deformity, tenderness and swelling </p>
<p>A good tool to remember the signs of injury is <span class="bodybold">DOTS</span>.<br>

    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> <span class="bodyboldUline">S</span>welling <br>
  <br>
  Conduct a head-to-toes <span class="bodybold">secondary examination</span>. Remember to be sensitive to the <span class="bodybold">age, sex and culture</span> of the casualty. <br>
  <br>
  Start the secondary examination by informing the casualty of what you are going to do and the reason for doing the examination. Listen carefully to what the casualty tells you while doing your examination. <br>
