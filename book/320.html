<p>The emergency action plan consists of seven steps:<br>
  <br>
  <span class="redbold">D</span><span class="bodybold">anger </span>(Safety)<span class="bodybold"><br>
    </span><span class="redbold">R</span><span class="bodybold">esponse<br>

      </span><span class="redbold">A</span><span class="bodybold">irway<br>
        </span><span class="redbold">B</span><span class="bodybold">reathing<br>
          </span><span class="redbold">C</span><span class="bodybold">ompressions<br>
            </span><span class="redbold">D</span><span class="bodybold">efibrillation</span><br>
  <br>
  These steps are known as <span class="redbold">DRSABCD</span> and are the major consideration for everyone involved in the care and treatment of casualties. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">Danger (Hazards, risks, safety) <br>
  </span><br>
  Once an emergency has occurred you need to ensure the safety of all those at the scene by checking for hazards. Check for any risk to: <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Yourself <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Bystanders <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Casualties <br>
  <br>
  Take the time to conduct a primary survey of the scene to look for anything that may threaten the safety of those on or around the scene. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">Hazards that may be present include: <br>
  </span><br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> bio-hazards <br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> bombs <br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> bullets<br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> chemicals<br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> electricity <br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> fire<br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> fumes <br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> gases <br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> smoke<br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> fallen power lines <br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> falling masonry <br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> fast flowing water <br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> flammable material <br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> on-coming traffic <br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> risk of explosion <br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> sharp metal edges <br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> slippery surfaces <br>
  <img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> unstable structures<br>
  <br>
  Leave dangerous situations to the emergency personnel who have the training and equipment to manage the situation. Risking your own safety in a dangerous situation may increase the number of casualties to manage. <br>
  <br>
  Other situations may permit the removal of the hazard, or the removal of the casualty from the hazard. Examples of removing a hazard would be cleaning away broken glass at a motor vehicle accident scene, or turning electricity off at the main powerboard in an electrocution incident. <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/emergency_1.jpg" width="300" height="236" class="floatright">As a general rule you should avoid moving casualties unless there is a hazard that you cannot remove, such as fire or poisonous fumes. Moving a casualty, especially an unconscious casualty, is very difficult and should be left to ambulance personnel who have the training and equipment necessary to protect themselves and the casualty. <br>
  <br>
  If it is essential to move a casualty before an ambulance arrives, take extreme care and use good manual handling practice. <br>
  <br>
  Provided they are not at further risk, you should check casualties in the position in which you find them. <br>
  <br>
  In the event that you are unable to check a casualty in the position that they are in, gently roll them onto their back, supporting the head and neck during movement. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold"><img src="images/emergency_2.jpg" width="300" height="158" class="floatright">Response <br>
  </span><br>
  Check the casualty for a response by touching the casualty's shoulders and asking loudly <span class="bodybolditalic">'are you all right'?</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">DO NOT</span> shake children and infants, and there is no need to aggressively shake a casualty to gain a response, just touching the casualty on the shoulders and talking loudly is an effective method and will awaken a sleeping person. <br>
  <br>
  A casualty that is unresponsive should be considered unconscious. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="greenbold">If the Casualty Responds<br>
  </span><br>
  If the casualty responds by answering and appears conscious, leave them in the position in which you find them (provided there is no further danger or risk). <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> check the casualty's condition and try to find our what is wrong<br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> get help if required<br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> observe and reassess the casualty regularly <br>
  <br>
  <span class="headred">If the Casualty Does Not Respond</span><br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> send for help </p>
<p><span class="bluebold">Send for help <br>
</span><br>
Sending for help as early as possible is important.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> shout for help to alert nearby people<br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> send someone for help<br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> ask them to find and bring an AED if available<br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if you are on your own, use your mobile phone to alert the ambulance service using Triple Zero <span class="bodybolditalic">(000)</span><br>
<img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> leave the casualty only when there is no other option available<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold"><img src="images/emergency_3.jpg" width="300" height="162" class="floatright">Airway <br>
    </span><br>
  Ensuring an open airway is essential. </p>
<p><span class="bodybold">Open Airway <br>
  </span><br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> turn the casualty onto their back<br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> place your hand on the forehead <br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> place your fingertips under the point of the casualty's chin <br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> gently tilt the head back and lift the chin to open the airway <br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> remove any clearly visible foreign bodies <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold"><img src="images/emergency_4.jpg" width="300" height="146" class="floatright">Breathing <br>
  </span><br>
  Keep the airway open and check for <span class="bodyitalic">normal breathing</span>. </p>
<p> <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> look, listen</span> and <span class="bodybolditalic">feel</span> for <span class="bodybold">no more</span> than 10 seconds for normal breathing <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> look</span> to see if the chest rises <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> listen</span> for the sound of normal breathing <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> feel</span> for air against your cheek<br>
  <br>
  In the first few minutes after a cardiac arrest, the casualty may be taking infrequent, slow and noisy gasps as well as sounds of gurgling, sighing or coughing.</p>
<p>This type of breathing is ineffective, as it does not move air into or out of the lungs and the casualty should be treated as if they are not breathing.<br>
  <span class="blue"><img src="images/infos.png" width="40" height="40" class="info"></span><br>
  <span class="blue">If you are in any doubt that the casualty is breathing normally, treat as if they are not breathing. <br>
    <br>
    </span><span class="greenbold"><img src="images/emergency_5.jpg" width="300" height="222" class="floatright">If Breathing Present</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> </span>roll into recovery position <br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> </span>check the casualty's condition and get help if needed <br>

  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> kneel by the side of the casualty <br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> place your hands, or two fingers with an infant, in the centre of the casualty's chest interlocking your fingers <br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> press straight down on the sternum 100 times per minute (a little less than 2 compressions a second) <br>

  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> compress 1/3 chest depth <br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> give 2 rescue breaths <br>
  <img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> open the airway with head tilt and chin lift<br>

  <img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> watch for chest rise<br>
  <img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> maintaining head tilt and chin lift, take your mouth away from the casualty and watch for the fall of the chest<br>

  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> continue 30 compressions and 2 rescue breaths cycles <br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> apply Automated External Defibrillator (AED) if available <br>
  <img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> follow the voice/visual prompts of the AED<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> DO NOT</span> apply any pressure over the casualty's ribs, upper abdomen or the bottom end of the bony sternum (breastbone) <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">Defibrillation <br>
    </span><br>
  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are safe and effective to use. Use of an AED by a layperson makes it possible to defibrillate many minutes before professional help arrives.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> </span>ensure safety<span class="bodybolditalic"> <br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> send someone for the AED if not already done <br>

  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> attach the electrode pads to the casualty's bare chest<br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> follow the spoken/visual prompts of the AED immediately<br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> ensure that nobody touches the casualty while the AED is analysing the rhythm <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold"> <img src="images/emergency_8.jpg" width="300" height="275" class="floatright">If a shock is indicated: <br>
    </span><br>
    <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> ensure that nobody touches the casualty <br>
    <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> push the shock button as directed<br>

  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> immediately resume CPR, using a ratio of 30 compressions to 2 rescue breaths<br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> continue to follow the voice/visual prompts of the AED  <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">If no shock is indicated: </span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> immediately resume CPR using a ratio of 30 compressions to 2 rescue breaths<br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> continue to follow the voice/visual prompts of the AED <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">Unsuccessful rescue breaths <br>
    </span><br>
  If rescue breaths do not make the chest rise with each attempt, proceed to compressions and give 30 compressions and then before your next attempt at rescue breaths: <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> check the casualty's mouth and remove any visible obstructions <br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> ensure that there is adequate head tilt and chin lift <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> DO NOT</span> attempt more than two rescue breaths each time before returning to chest compressions <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">Chest compression only CPR <br>
    </span><br>
  If for any reason rescue breaths can not be given, chest compressions should still be administered as some oxygen will still be circulated. Compress in the centre of the casualty's chest continuously 100 times per minute. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">Checking for signs of life <br>
    </span><br>
    Do not stop to re-check the casualty for signs of life unless they start breathing normally again.</p>
<p>It is important to minimise interruptions to chest compressions.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">Multiple rescuers <br>
    </span><br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> ensure that an ambulance has been called <br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> ensure that someone has been sent to get equipment, such as an AED <br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> if there is more than one rescuer present, change over the roll of performing CPR approximately every 2 minutes to reduce fatigue <br>
  <span class="bodybolditalic"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> change over with minimal delay between compressions <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">Duration of CPR <br>
    </span><br>
    CPR should continue until:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> The casualty starts to wake up, move, open eyes or to breathe normally <br>
    <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> The scene becomes unsafe <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Qualified help arrives and takes over <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Signs of life return <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> It is impossible to continue (eg. exhaustion, scene becomes unsafe)<br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> An authorised person pronounces life extinct <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">When to get help <br>
    </span><br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> If more than one rescuer is available, one should start resuscitation while another rescuer goes for assistance <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> In children or infants if only one rescuer is available, then perform 1 minute of CPR before leaving to go for assistance <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> If the casualty is an infant or small child it may be possible to take them with you <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> If the collapse was sudden, not caused by trauma or poisoning and the casualty is a child with a history of heart disease, go for help immediately <br>
  <br>
  <span class="redbold"><img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> Remember: Any resuscitation is better than no resuscitation at all!<br>
