<p>When breathing has been restored, it is essential to maintain the airway and ensure that the tongue, fluids or other objects do not cause an obstruction. It is also important to reduce the risk of inhalation of stomach contents. <br>
  <br>
  Any unconscious casualty who remains on their back risks an obstructed airway by solids or fluid, or by having their upper airway blocked by a relaxed tongue. <br>
  <br>
  The most effective way of controlling this problem is to put the unconscious breathing casualty in a position that ensures the airway remains open by draining away any vomitus, or by allowing the relaxed tongue to move away from the airway opening. This position is called the recovery position. <br>
  <br>
  This position places the casualty on their side, with the head down and tilted in such a way which expels any fluid onto the ground, and the tongue falls clear of the airway opening. <br>
