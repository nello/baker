<p>Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is Rescue Breathing used in conjunction with Chest Compressions. CPR is the most effective form of active resuscitation available today and is used universally by first aiders and medical personnel alike. The technique is vital in supplying oxygen and blood circulation to the casualty and is used to 'buy time' in resuscitation of casualties in cardiac arrest. <br>
  <br>
  Rescue breaths provide oxygen to the casualty's lungs and blood while chest compressions, when applied correctly pumps the oxygenated blood around the body. Effective CPR will &quot;buy time&quot; for a casualty by circulating blood and oxygen around the body reducing damage to vital organs such as the brain. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">Indications for CPR <br>
  </span><br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Unconscious (unresponsive) <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Not moving <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> No <span class="bodyitalic">normal</span> breathing, although there may be brief irregular, 'gasping' breaths <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold"><img src="images/chest_2.jpg" width="300" height="250" class="floatright">Procedure for CPR <br>
  </span><br>
  To provide effective compressions the first aider must compress in the centre of the casualty's chest. <br>

  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> place the heel of one hand in the centre of the casualty's chest <br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> place the heel of the other hand on top of the first hand and interlock the fingers of the hands <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> DO NOT</span> apply any pressure over the casualty's ribs, upper abdomen or the bottom end of the bony sternum (breastbone) <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> position yourself directly above the casualty's chest and, with your arms straight, press down on the sternum 1/3 depth of chest <br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> release all the pressure on the chest without losing contact between the hands and the sternum <br>
  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> give 30 compressions at a rate of about 100 times a minute (a little less than 2 compressions a second) <br>

  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">Chest compression only CPR</span><br>
  <br>
  If for any reason rescue breaths can not be given, chest compressions should still be administered as some oxygen will still be circulated. Compress in the centre of the casualty's chest continuously 100 times per minute. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">Re-checking for circulation</span><br>
  <br>
  You should only stop to re-check the casualty if they start breathing normally again, otherwise do not interrupt resuscitation. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">Multiple rescuers <br>
  </span><br>
  If there is more than one rescuer present, change over the role of performing CPR approximately every 2 minutes to reduce fatigue. Change over with minimal delay of compressions. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">When to stop CPR <br>
  </span><br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Qualified help arrives and takes over <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> The casualty starts breathing normally <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> You become physically unable to continue <br>
  <br>
  <span class="bluebold">When to get help <br>
  </span><br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> If more than one rescuer is available, one should start resuscitation while another rescuer goes for assistance <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> In children or infants if only one rescuer is available, then perform 1 minute of CPR before leaving to go for assistance <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> If the casualty is an infant or small child it may be possible to take them with you <br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> If the collapse was sudden, not caused by trauma or poisoning and the casualty is a child with a history of heart disease, go for help immediately </p>
