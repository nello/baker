<p class="headline"><img src="images/h_trauma.png" width="265" height="44" class="banner">Bleeding</p>
<p>The body must have enough circulating blood volume to keep the body functioning, and keep the organs supplied with oxygen. Blood consists of red cells, which convey oxygen throughout the body; white cells, which fight introduced infection; platelets, which assist in the clotting process; and plasma, the fluid portion of blood. There are between five and seven litres of blood in the average adult body which makes up 7-8% of the body weight.<br>
<br>
Blood is moved around the body under pressure by the heart and blood vessels. Without an adequate blood volume and pressure, the human body soon collapses. Bleeding, or <span class="bodyitalic">haemorrhage</span>, poses a threat by causing both the volume and the pressure of the blood within the body to decrease through blood loss when blood vessels rupture due to a severe injury.<br>
<br>
Bleeding is one of the common causes of death in accidents. The aim of the first aider is to reduce the loss of blood from the casualty.<br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold">External bleeding<br>
</span><br>
External bleeding is usually associated with wounds. Serious wounds involve damage to blood vessels. Damage to an artery is characterised by <span class="brightred">bright red</span> blood which can spurt with each heartbeat. Damage to veins appears as a <span class="darkerred">darker red</span> and tends to <span class="bodyitalic">flow</span>. Capillary damage is associated with wounds close to the skin and is a <span class="brightred">bright red</span> and oozes.<br>
<br>
A wound is caused when our body tissue is torn or cut. Types of wounds include <span class="bodyitalic">abrasions, amputations, incisions, lacerations</span> and <span class="bodyitalic">punctures</span>.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/bleeding_1.jpg" width="600" height="600"><br>
<br>
<span class="bodybold">Abrasion:</span> is a wound where the skin layers have been scraped off from a fall on a rough surface, pieces of shells, claws of animals, machinery etc. These wounds have torn or irregular edges and they tend to bleed less.<br>
<br>
<span class="bodybold">Amputation:</span> is the severing or partial severing of part of the body, such as a limb or part of a limb.<br>
<br>
<span class="bodybold">Incision:</span> is a wound characterised by ‘slicing’ as with a sharp knife or sharp piece of metal. It is often characterised by a narrow wound which has cut cleanly and bleeds extensively.<br>
<br>
<span class="bodybold">Laceration:</span> is a jagged-edge wound with associated tissue loss, such as from a barbed wire fence injury, or where a rider’s ankles, knees, elbows or wrists have abraded at speed, colliding with a road surface.<br>
<br>
<span class="bodybold">Puncture</span> wounds are perforations, from anything from a corkscrew to a bullet, and generally with a limited external area but potentially quite deep, affecting internal organs.<br>
<br>
Some bleeding, such as Varicose veins, can often rupture with little or no injury.<br>

  <br>
  If bleeding occurs through the existing dressing, place a second dressing over the first leaving the existing dressing in place. Remove and replace only the bandage and padding. Maintain direct pressure over the bleeding area as much as possible. Avoid disturbing the bandage or pad once the bleeding has been controlled. <br>
  <br>
  Wounds can be cleaned with clean water or sodium chloride. <br>
  <span class="blue"><img src="images/infos.png" width="40" height="40" class="info"></span><br>
  <span class="blue">With all wounds, the casualty should obtain medical advice for tetanus prevention. <br>
  </span><br>
  <span class="bluebold">Internal bleeding <br>
  </span><br>
  Internal bleeding is classified as either <span class="bodybolditalic">visible</span>, in that the bleeding can be seen, or <span class="bodybolditalic">concealed</span>, where no direct evidence of bleeding is obvious. <br>
  <br>
  Always consider internal bleeding after injury, understanding it cannot be controlled by the first aider. <br>
  <br>
  In most instances, obtaining an adequate history of the incident or illness will give the first aid provider the necessary clue as to whether internal bleeding may be present. <br>
  <br>
  Remember that current signs and symptoms, or the lack of them, do not necessarily indicate the casualty's condition. <br>
  <br>
  Certain critical signs and symptoms may not appear until well after the incident due to the stealth of the bleed, and may only be detected by the fact that the casualty's observations worsen despite there being no visible cause. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="greenbold">Visible Internal Bleeding<br>
  </span><br>
  Visible internal bleeding is referred to this way because the results can be seen in bleeding from: <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> <span class="bodybold">Anus or vagina</span> – usually red blood mixed with mucus <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Ears</span> – bright, sticky blood or blood mixed with clear fluid <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Lungs</span> – frothy, bright red blood coughed up by the casualty <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Stomach, bowel or intestines</span> – bright, dark or tarry blood <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Under the skin (bruising)</span> – the tissues look dark due to the blood under the skin <br>
  <span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Urinary tract</span> – dark or red coloured urine <br>
  <br>
  <span class="greenbold">Concealed Internal Bleeding<br>
  </span><br>
  Detecting internal bleeding relies upon good observations and an appreciation of the physical forces that have affected the casualty. In these cases, the first aid provider relies heavily on history, signs and symptoms. If you are unsure, assume the worst and treat for internal bleeding. <br>
  <br>
  Remember to look at the important observations that may indicate internal bleeding, which include: <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Skin appearance <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Conscious state <br>
  <img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Pulse <br>
