<p>Burns are injuries that damage and kill skin cells, and are most commonly caused by exposure to flames, hot objects, hot liquids, chemicals, radiation or a combination of these. Scalds are caused by contact with wet heat such as boiling fluids or steam. Electrical burns are less common, but have the potential to be more serious as the depth of the burn is usually greater than is apparent, and heart irregularities may occur. <br>
<br>
<img src="images/burns_1.jpg" width="256" height="400" class="floatright">As with most potentially serious injuries, prevention is better than cure. All homes should be fitted with smoke detectors. Keep hot objects, such as kettles, safely out of reach of children and make sure to turn off heaters and stoves when not in use. <br>
<br>
Also keep all electrical wires away from water, place socket caps over all unused electrical sockets and have your leads tested and tagged regularly. Keep household chemicals out of reach of children, ensure these are well marked and their caps are screwed on tight. <br>

<br>
<span class="bodybold">Scalds</span> are caused by contact with wet heat such as boiling fluids or steam. <br>
<br>
A doctor should see infants or children who receive any burns. <br>
<br>
It is important that any casualty who has inhaled smoke, fumes or superheated air, or has been burnt on the face, seeks medical aid as soon as possible after the incident. <br>
<br>
Electrical burns have the potential to be more serious as the depth of the burn is usually greater than is apparent and cardiac (heart) irregularities may occur. <br>
