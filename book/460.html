<p>Facial injuries require special attention because they can damage several of the 'senses', the airway and possibly result in permanent disfigurement. Contusions, lacerations and puncture wounds can permanently disfigure the casualty. In the case of the cheek and chin, injuries also may result in loss of function if facial nerves or muscles are injured. <br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold"><img src="images/facial_1.jpg" width="283" height="188" class="floatright">Ear injuries <br>
</span><br>
The ear has two functions; as the receptacle of the auditory senses (hearing), and as the organ of balance. Injuries to the ear usually affect hearing function rather than balance. <br>
<br>
Children are especially at risk of ear damage by inserting small objects into the ear canal. This can have serious effects on the tympanic membrane or 'eardrum'. An old, but sensible, saying is that 'nothing smaller than the elbow should be poked in the ear'. <br>
<br>
The eardrum is easily damaged. Holes or tears may be caused by swimming and diving beneath the surface, change in altitude (flying), or by vigorous nose-blowing when 'stuffed up' with a cold or flu. Minor eardrum injuries usually spontaneously repair themselves over a period of hours. <br>

<span class="bluebold"><img src="images/facial_2.png" width="295" height="262" class="floatright">Eye injuries <br>
</span><br>
The eye is a robust but delicate organ. It can sustain quite severe damage and, with the proper treatment, recover to its former state. In some instances, however, a seemingly 'minor' injury can be permanently disabling. <br>
<br>
Always consider preventing eye injuries and taking sufficient protective measures (such as protective glasses or goggles). Generally, eye injuries are considered as either minor or major injuries. <br>

Minor Eye Injuries</span><br>
<br>
<img src="images/facial_3.jpg" width="200" height="133" class="floatleft">These are injuries where the eye has come in contact with a foreign object causing minor irritation, or the object remains on the surface of the eye. It is characterised by a bloodshot eye, irritation and an urge to rub the eye. <br>

<br>
<span class="greenbold"><img src="images/facial_4.jpg" width="200" height="300" class="floatright">Major Eye Injuries</span><br>
<br>
These are injuries that involve the penetration of the body of the eye, or involve severe blunt trauma to the eye. These injuries are characterised by blood in the eye, penetrating objects, disturbance of vision, protrusion of eye contents, and severe pain and spasms. Casualty care in this case is critical, and should be left to the experts. <br>

<span class="greenbold"><img src="images/facial_7.jpg" width="200" height="300" class="floatright">Welder's Flash<br>
</span><br>
Flash burn and welder's flash is the result of staring <br>
or inadvertently looking at the intense light caused during metal welding, while not wearing the correct eye protection.<br>
<br>
Care must be taken to supervise children if welding is being conducted near them, and they should be removed from the location. The damage caused to the eye's cornea by exposure to this intense light can be painful and, in some cases, permanent. <br>
<span class="headred"><img src="images/cross.png" width="44" height="44" class="cross"><br>
Care and Treatment<br>
<br>
</span><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> apply cool compresses and cover the eyes with pads <br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> urgent medical attention if pain or spots persist <br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold">Tooth injuries <br>
</span><br>
The structure of the tooth includes dentin, pulp and other tissues, blood vessels and nerves embedded in the bony jaw. Above the gum line, the tooth is protected by the hard enamel covering. <br>
<br>
<img src="images/facial_8.jpg" width="600" height="407"><br>
<span class="subitalic">Anatomy of a Tooth</span><br>
<br>
When a tooth is knocked out, appropriate emergency medical and dental care is necessary. If a child is 7 or more it is likely to be a second or permanent tooth. A second or permanent tooth can often be saved if prompt action is taken, and the tooth is handled carefully. <br>
<br>
The delicate tissue covering the root must be protected to ensure successful re-implantation. <br>
<br>
If a child is 6 or less it is likely to be a baby or primary tooth. Baby teeth may become injured after a fall and turn grey in colour. Treatment is not always necessary, but it is best to have the dentist examine the child as soon as possible. <br>
<img src="images/cross.png" width="44" height="44" class="cross"><br>
<span class="headred">Care and Treatment<br>
</span><br>
<span class="bodybold">When a baby or toddler injures gums or teeth: <br>
</span><br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if there is bleeding, put cold water on a piece of gauze and apply pressure to the site <br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> offer the casualty an icy pole or ice cube to suck, to reduce swelling <br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> call your dentist. They will probably want to see the child to assess the need for realignment, or removal of a very loose tooth <br>
<br>
<span class="bodybold">If a permanent tooth is knocked out: <br>
</span><br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> hold the tooth by the crown (chewing edge), not the root <br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> rinse the tooth immediately with saline solution or milk,avoid scrubbing material off it. If this is not possible, wrap in plastic cling wrap <br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if the casualty will co-operate, replace the tooth gently in its socket <br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> have the casualty bite down gently on a gauze pad to keep the tooth in place <br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if the tooth cannot be re-inserted, put it in milk which is a good preservative because its chemical make-up is compatible with teeth <br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if milk is not available, the tooth can be placed in the casualty's mouth between the teeth and cheek, if old enough not to swallow the tooth. If this is not possible, wrap in plastic cling wrap <br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> give the casualty a gauze pad or handkerchief to gently bite down on, which will help control bleeding and ease the pain <br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> see a dentist right away, within 20 minutes if possible <br>
<br>
<img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> <span class="bodybold">DO NOT</span> replace the tooth or place anything in the mouth of a drowsy or unconscious casualty <br>
<br>
<img src="images/facial_9.jpg" width="200" height="134" class="floatright">If the tooth can't be re-implanted, control bleeding by placing a gauze pad in the tooth socket, and then get the casualty to bite gently down on the pad. Avoid rinsing out the mouth because this can interfere with blood clotting. <br>
<br>
If the gums are bleeding, put cold water on a piece of gauze and push it between the lips and gums. Have the casualty hold pressure on the bleeding site. </p>
