<p class="headline"><img src="images/h_trauma.png" width="265" height="44" class="banner">Spinal Injuries</p>
<p><img src="images/spinal_1.png" width="171" height="800" class="floatright">The spinal column consists of a series of interconnected bones, called vertebrae, which enclose the <span class="bodyitalic">spinal cord</span>, an integral part of the central nervous system. It is the spinal cord and its attached nerves which provides the means by which we breathe, move and use our senses. <br>
<br>
Between each vertebra are discs of cartilage that act as shock absorbers and allow the spinal column a degree of flexibility. The spine is divided into five areas: <br>
<br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"></span> The <span class="bodybold">cervical</span> spine (neck), 7 vertebrae <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"></span> The <span class="bodybold">thoracic</span> spine (chest), 12 vertebrae <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"></span> The <span class="bodybold">lumbar</span> spine (back), 5 vertebrae<br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"></span> Fused vertebrae of the <span class="bodybold">sacrum</span><br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"></span> A small vertebra called the <span class="bodybold">coccyx</span><br>
<br>
Any injury to the spinal cord has serious ramifications for our ability to function normally, and an injury, or 'lesion', of the cord may cause quadriplegia (complete or partial paralysis of all four limbs); paraplegia (complete or partial paralysis of the lower limbs only); loss of: skin sensation, bowel, bladder and/or sexual function as well as chronic painful conditions, depending on the the injury along the spinal cord. <br>
<br>
The nearer the head the lesion occurs, the more serious it is, affecting all levels of the body below it and potentially causing death if the nerves to the heart and lungs are involved. <br>
<br>
Even if the casualty is not affected to these degrees of severity, spinal injury may cause chronic back pain and restricted spinal flexibility. <br>
<br>
Spinal injuries can be caused by a variety of physical incidents. A common cause of spinal injuries is motorcycle accidents. Riders and pillion passengers are thrown unprotected to the roadway and invariably land heavily in an awkward manner, putting stress on the spinal column. Carefully assessing the history of the incident and the mechanism of injury will benefit the first aid provider before they apply active treatment. Road traffic accidents, diving accidents and sporting accidents provide the majority of spinal casualties. <br>

<span class="headred">Care and Treatment</span><br>
<br>
<img src="images/spinal_2.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="floatright"><span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> If airway is not open, use jaw thrust or manual opening of the jaw rather than extending the neck <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> if unable to control airway â€“ carefully remove the helmet while ensuring the minimum of neck movement <br>
<img src="images/phone.png" width="22" height="22"> call Triple Zero <span class="bodybolditalic">(000)</span> for an ambulance <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> extreme care in initial examination <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> always maintain the casualty's head in line with the shoulders and spine using manual support. Ensure the head is supported, not pulled or pushed in any direction <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> if trained to, apply cervical collar <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> position on spinal stretcher and use head-immobilisation device if trained to do so and equipment available <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> treat for shock <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> treat any other injuries <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> maintain body heat <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> if movement required, 'log roll' using 2-3 assistants <br>
<br>
<img src="images/examining_5.jpg" width="400" height="184"><br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold">Spinal shock <br>
</span><br>
Spinal shock refers to changes in blood pressure associated with injury to the spine. The blood pressure is usually lower than normal (as in shock due to blood loss), however, the pulse is usually normal or slow (the opposite of shock due to blood loss). The skin may be cold and clammy as a result.<br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold">Helmet removal <br>
</span><br>
Helmets should only be removed if you intend to perform CPR or if the helmet is impeding proper airway management. Otherwise, leave helmet removal to the experts. The helmet could be helping prevent (further) spinal or head injuries. <br>
<br>
Immobilise the casualty's head and spine by having one person place their hands on either side of the casualty's head (palms inwards) to keep it from moving. If you can, immobilise the neck and/or spine by placing rolled towels, articles of clothing, etc. on both sides of the neck and/or body, but don't interfere with the casualty's airway or breathing. <br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold">Cervical collar <br>
</span><br>
A cervical collar helps immobilise the neck where cervical injury is suspected. First aiders trained in their use should apply a cervical collar, though it requires two people to apply correctly. <br>
<br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> the first rescuer applies manual support to the head and neck <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> if the collar is adjustable, or several sizes are available, measure the correct size according to the manufacturer's instructions <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> the second rescuer slides the front of the collar along the casualty's chest and positions the chin piece <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> the second rescuer gently wraps the ends of the collar snugly around the casualty's neck <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> the second rescuer secures the collar with the Velcro tab <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> ensure collar is firm and comfortable, adjust if necessary <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"></span> maintain support to the head and neck during all adjustments <br>
