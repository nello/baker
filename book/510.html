<p class="headline"><img src="images/h_trauma.png" width="265" height="44" class="banner">Fractures</p>
<p>There are 206 bones in the human body. The skeleton holds our skin up, and bones act as factories for producing blood and essential blood cells through bone marrow. Bones are also integral to the body's strength. <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/fractures_1.jpg" width="600" height="950"><br>
<br>
Some bones have a protective function (skull), some a supporting function (pelvis), while others are for movement (fingers). <br>
<br>
When a bone is broken, or fractured, it affects not only blood production and function, but there can be complications associated with the muscles, tendons, nerves and blood vessels that are attached, or are close, to the bone. <br>
<br>
<span class="bodybold">Fractures are generally classified as: <br>
</span><br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> <span class="bodybold">Open</span> – where there is a wound exposing the fracture site, or the bone is protruding from the skin. <br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> <span class="bodybold">Closed</span> – where the bone has fractured but has no obvious external wound. <br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> <span class="bodybold">Complicated</span> – which may involve damage to associated vital organs and major blood vessels as a result of the fracture. <br>
<br>
Immobilisation is the preferred way to manage fractured limbs as it helps reduce movement and the pain associated with fractures. Immobilise the limb with a natural splint, such as another part of the body, improvised splints, cardboard, wooden or air splints. <br>
<br>
<span class="bodybold">Fractures may be caused a number of ways: <br>
</span><br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Direct force</span>; where sufficient force is applied to cause the bone to fracture at the point of impact. <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Indirect force</span>; where force or kinetic energy, applied to a large, strong bone, is transmitted up the limb, causing the weakest bones to fracture. <br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Spontaneous</span> or <span class="bodybold">spasm-induced</span>; where fractures are associated with disease and/or muscular spasms.These are usually associated with the elderly, and people with specific diseases affecting the bones. <br>
<br>
<img src="images/fractures_2.jpg" width="400" height="92"><br>
<br>
Always exercise care when assessing an elderly casualty as the condition known as osteoporosis or 'Chalky Bones' causes bones to fracture easily, often in several places. Always suspect a fracture if an elderly person complains of pain or loss of power to a limb. <br>
<br>
Be especially aware of fractures at the neck of the femur (near the hip), a very common fracture in the elderly. <br>
<br>
Young children are also prone to fractures. Arm and wrist fractures are common with children. As young bones do not harden for some years, children's fractures tend to 'bend and splinter', similar to a broken branch on a tree – hence the common name 'greenstick fracture'. <br>

<span class="headred">Signs and Symptoms<br>
</span><br>
Some, or all of the following: <br>
<br>
<img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> pale, cool, clammy skin <br>
<img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> rapid, weak pulse <br>

<img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> tenderness <br>
<img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> loss of power to limb <br>
<img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> associated wound and blood loss <br>

<img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> deformity <br>
<img src="images/cross.png" width="44" height="44" class="cross"><br>
<span class="headred">Care and Treatment<br>
</span><br>
<img src="images/fractures_3.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="floatright">Care and treatment of fractures relies on immobilising and adequately splinting the injury. If the fracture is particularly complex, the wound associated with an open fracture maybe difficult to control. <br>
<br>
If the pulse further down the limb cannot be restored by gentle and careful adjustment of the limb or with minor traction, the limb should be stabilised where it is. <br>
<br>
Do not spend time attempting to splint instead of calling for urgent ambulance transport. <br>
<br>
Circulation must be checked after a splint or sling has been applied. If the limb swells this will make the bandages tighter and this may cause circulation problems. <br>
<br>
<span class="bodybold">Indications that a bandage may be too tight include: <br>
</span><br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Absent pulse below the bandage <br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Pale/blue appearance below the bandage <br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Lack of warmth below the bandage <br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Pain <br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Swelling <br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Tingling or loss of feeling in fingers or toes <br>
<br>
Generally, fractured limbs should be kept immobile until medical assistance arrives. However, in remote areas or where it is some time from medical aid, you may be required to treat as follows: <br>
<br>
<span class="greenbold">Fractured Arm/Collar Bone <br>

<br>
Care must be exercised with a suspected fractured pelvis. This injury may have serious complications. The casualty should always be transported by ambulance and not by alternative means unless absolutely essential. <br>
<br>
<span class="greenbold">Fractured Jaw<br>
</span><br>
A common injury in certain contact sports is dislocation, or fracture, of the lower jaw (mandible). The casualty will have pain in the jaw, be unable to speak properly, and may have trouble swallowing. <br>
<br>
<img src="images/phone.png" width="22" height="22"> call Triple Zero <span class="bodybolditalic">(000)</span> for an ambulance <br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> support the jaw <br>
<img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> sit the casualty leaning slightly forward <br>
<img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> rest the injured jaw on a pad held by the casualty <br>
<br>
<img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> <span class="bodybold">DO NOT</span> apply a bandage to support the jaw. <br>
<br>
Observe the casualty carefully for signs of breathing difficulties and any indication they are becoming drowsy or unconscious. <br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold">Dislocations <br>
</span><br>
Dislocations involve the displacement of bone from a joint. These injuries are often underestimated, and can have serious consequences in the form of damage to nerves and blood vessels. Many people have joints which dislocate easily due to a congenital condition, or weak ligaments, stretched by previous repeated dislocations. <br>

<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> any attempt to reduce a dislocation is only to be made by a doctor <br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold">Slings <br>
</span><br>
<img src="images/fractures_4.jpg" width="261" height="300" class="floatright">Use slings to support an injured arm, or to supplement treatment for another injury such as fractured ribs. Generally, the most effective sling is made with a triangular bandage. Every first aid kit, no matter how small, should have at least one of these bandages as essential items. <br>
<br>
Although triangular bandages are preferable, any material, eg tie, belt, or piece of thick twine or rope, can be used in an emergency. If no likely material is at hand, an injured arm can be adequately supported by inserting it inside the casualty's shirt or blouse. Similarly, a safety pin applied to a sleeve and secured to clothing on the chest may suffice. <br>
<br>
There are essentially three types of sling; the arm sling for injuries to the forearm, the elevated sling for injuries to the shoulder, and the 'collar-and-cuff' or clove hitch for injuries to the upper arm and as supplementary support to fractured ribs. <br>
<br>
<img src="images/fractures_3.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="floatright">After applying any sling, always check the circulation to the limb by feeling for the pulse at the wrist, or squeezing a fingernail and observing for change of colour in the nail bed. <br>
<br>
All slings must be in a position that is comfortable for the casualty. Never force an arm into the 'right position'. <br>
<br>
<span class="greenbold">Arm Sling <br>
</span><br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> Support the injured forearm approximately parallel to the ground with the wrist slightly higher than the elbow <br>
