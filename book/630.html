		<p class="headline"><img src="images/h_medical.png" width="265" height="44" class="banner">Croup and Epiglottitis</p>
		<p>Croup is a viral infection of the voice box and windpipe and epiglottitis is a bacterial infection of the epiglottis, the 'flap'-like valve that guards the airway. <br>
		<br>
		Both croup and epiglottitis are conditions that mainly affect children.<br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold"><img src="images/croup_1.jpg" width="300" height="200" class="floatright">Croup <br>
		</span><br>
		The onset of croup is slow, usually after another illness, such as a cold or a sore throat. Croup will normally last three to four days and the child may have repeated attacks. Croup is often a mild illness but can get worse quickly, and is often worse at night. <br>

		<span class="headred">Care and Treatment<br>
		</span><br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> reassure the child <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> manage any fevers â€“ the doctor may direct you to give them paracetamol if they have a fever. Follow the instructions on the packet regarding dose <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> give frequent drinks to keep the child well hydrated <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if there is severe breathing difficulty, or, if the child is distressed, seek medical assistance<br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"><span class="bodybold"> DO NOT</span> examine the throat <br>
		<img src="images/a_alert2.png" width="22" height="22"> <span class="bodybold">DO NOT</span> use steam as it does not help and may lead to accidental burns <br>
		<br>
		Croup can quickly become serious, so do not hesitate to get medical help. There is effective treatment for severe episodes of croup. <br>
		<br>
		Humidification of the air is often recommended for croup but there is no information to prove that it has any benefits and increases the risk of burns from the hot water or steam. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Epiglottitis <br>
		</span><br>
		Epiglottitis is usually due to infection by the <span class="bodyitalic">Influenza B</span> bacteria. <span class="bodybolditalic">It is a life-threatening condition. </span>It affects children in the two to seven year range with four years the most common age affected. <br>
		<br>
		The infection of the epiglottis causes a gradual obstruction of the airway by the swollen tissue. <br>
		<span class="blue"><img src="images/infos.png" width="40" height="40" class="info"></span><br>
		<span class="blue">Epiglottitis is an emergency and requires urgent ambulance transport to hospital. <br>
