		<p>Cardiovascular disease is a term which describes disease to the heart and blood vessels, including stroke. According to the Heart Foundation, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Australia, accounting for 38% of all deaths in 2002; claiming the lives of more than one in three Australians. <br>
		<br>
		Coronary artery disease is the greatest single cause of death among Australians, followed by stroke. <br>

		<span class="subitalic">Blood Flow through the Heart</span><br>
		<br>
		The heart is a muscular pump, approximately the same size as its owner's fist, and is located behind and slightly to the left of the breastbone. The heart pumps blood to all parts of the body. The blood provides the body with the oxygen and nourishment it needs to function. Waste products carried by the blood are removed from the body by the kidneys and lungs. <br>
		<br>
		The body contains about five litres of blood which passes through the heart about every minute. But when necessary, such as when exercising, the heart can pump up to four times that amount per minute. <br>
		<br>
		A network of blood vessels carries the blood pumped by the heart around the body. The heart and blood vessels together make up your circulatory system. <br>
		<br>
		Due to factors such as lack of exercise, poor diet, advanced age, and chronic disease, the heart is sometimes compromised, and serious cardiac conditions develop. The four major conditions are: angina, heart attack, heart failure, and cardiac arrest. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="greenbold"><img src="images/heart_1.jpg" width="200" height="300" class="floatright">Chest Pain</span><br>
		<br>
		Chest pain can be one of the most difficult observations to make as every person has a different 'pain threshold'. Always ask open questions such as &quot;can you describe your pain to me&quot;, not &quot;does your pain feel sharp&quot;. <br>
		<br>
		Pain can be described as squeezing, crushing, vice-like, heavy, dull, sharp, pressure and many others. Cardiac pain is usually in the centre of the chest, or behind the breastbone. The pain may spread or radiate to the shoulders, neck, jaw and/or arms. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Heart attack <br>
		</span><br>
		A <span class="bodyitalic">heart attack</span> occurs when a coronary artery is suddenly blocked by a blood clot and the part of the heart muscle supplied by that artery is damaged due to lack of oxygen. Also known as a <span class="bodybold">coronary occlusion or myocardial infarction</span>, a <span class="bodybolditalic">heart attack</span> can occur at any time, at any age. <br>
		<span class="blue"><img src="images/infos.png" width="40" height="40" class="info"></span><br>
		<span class="blue">With heart attack, every minute counts. If the warning signs are present, do not waste vital moments wondering whether it is a heart attack or not. Take immediate action! <br>
		</span><br>
		Fatty deposits called plaque build up inside blood vessels and reduce the blood flow. In some cases the plaque builds up so that the vessel is blocked completely. Reduced blood flow can also allow a clot to form and the clot blocks the vessel. When a blockage occurs, oxygen is not delivered to the heart and part of the heart muscle dies. Blockage can occur in one or several coronary arteries. <br>

		<span class="subitalic">Plaque Buildup Inside Blood Vessels</span><br>
		<br>
		Certain people are at greater risk, due to factors such as hereditary influence, lack of exercise, smoking, poor diet, and high blood pressure. Urgent medical attention is vital. <br>

		<span class="bluebold">Angina <br>
		</span><br>
		<span class="bodyitalic">Angina Pectoris</span> (literally 'pain in the chest'), is a condition caused by constriction of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle with blood. The chest pain or discomfort is due to a reduction of blood supply to the heart muscle which causes a lack of oxygen to the heart muscle. <br>
		<br>
		Angina has very similar signs and symptoms to a heart attack. Some casualties do not feel 'pain', just an unpleasant sensation or discomfort in the chest. <br>
		<br>
		Angina will usually occur when the heart has to work harder than normal, such as during exercise, or in response to stress. It does not occur all the time because the blood supply, although reduced, is usually able to keep up with the heart's normal demands. <br>
		<br>
		Angina is usually relieved by rest. When rest alone does not bring rapid or effective relief then the use of nitroglycerine tablets or spray is often needed. Anginine is a common medication taken by Angina sufferers. The pain or discomfort is usually relieved within a couple of minutes, however, if the signs and symptoms last more than 10 to 15 minutes, an ambulance should be called immediately, and the casualty treated for heart attack. <br>

		</span><br>
		Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to perform its proper function, blood and fluid collects around the lungs and in the body. The casualty finds it difficult to breathe and swelling of the ankles and legs occurs as fluid pools in the extremities. <br>
