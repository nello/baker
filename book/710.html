		<p class="headline"><img src="images/h_medical.png" width="265" height="44" class="banner">Meningitis</p>
		<p>Meningitis is a term used to indicate inflammation of the thin membrane that covers the brain and spinal cord. There is a fluid between the meninges and the brain and spinal cord called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which becomes infected. <br>
		<br>
		There are many types of meningitis and whilst the symptoms are similar for each, the causes, treatments and outcomes do vary. Meningitis is mainly due to infection by either viruses or bacteria. Much rarer causes include fungi or cancer cells. <br>
		<br>
		In general, meningitis due to bacteria is more severe than meningitis caused by viruses. Most children with viral meningitis recover completely. However, some children with bacterial meningitis may develop long-term problems, but this depends on the bacterium involved and the age of the child. <br>

		<br>
		Should your child exhibit some of these signs and symptoms, and you are suspicious of their ability to respond appropriately, take the child to hospital. <br>
		<br>
		If the child is feverish, vomiting and drowsy, call Triple Zero <span class="bodybolditalic">(000)</span> for an ambulance. Remember that meningitis involves hospitalisation, so the earlier you contact the experts, the better. <br>
		<br>
		Bacterial meningitis can be treated with antibiotics, and most children recover. Viral meningitis usually gets better on its own. Most healthy children and adults with viral meningitis make a complete recovery without long-term problems unless they also have encephalitis. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Meningococcal infection <br>
		</span><br>
		Meningococcus is a bacteria which invades the bloodstream causing septicaemia. It can also invade the lining of the brain called meningitis. <br>
		<br>
		Children or young adults with meningococcal septicaemia are very ill, have a high fever and may develop a red or purple rash that looks like purple dots or bruises. <br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/meningitis_1.jpg" width="300" height="274"><br>
		<span class="subitalic">Purple rash on skin of meningococcus casualty</span><br>
		<br>
		A useful test for the rash is called the tumbler test. Press a glass tumbler firmly against the rash. If the marks stay the same colour and do not fade, then get help immediately. <br>

		<br>
		Some vaccines for meningococcal infection are available, but they do not protect against all types of meningococci. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Pneumococcal meningitis <br>
		</span><br>
		Pneumococcal disease refers to a range of illnesses that affect various parts of the body and are caused by infection with the bacterium <span class="bodyitalic">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span>, commonly known as the pneumococcus. Illnesses range from mild infections to pneumonia and life-threatening infections of the bloodstream and central nervous system, such as meningitis. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Infection with the pneumococcus bacterium can cause: <br>

		<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Meningitis <br>

		The symptoms for pneumococcal disease are not the same as meningococcal disease and a skin rash is NOT common. <br>
