<p>According to the National Stroke Foundation, stroke is the second most largest cause of death. In 2009, around 60,000 people will have a stroke in Australia. <br>
<br>
A stroke is a brain attack and when a person suffers a stroke, essential supplies of blood and oxygen are cut off from the cells in the brain. These control everything we do such as speech, movement and breathing. <br>

<span class="blue">Treat stroke with the same degree of seriousness as a heart attack. <br>
</span><br>
<span class="bodybold">Two common causes prompt strokes: <br>
</span><br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> A blocked blood vessel to the brain (an occlusion), <br>
<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> A ruptured blood vessel causing bleeding into the brain (intracranial haemorrhage). <br>
<br>

<span class="subitalic">Cross Section of the Brain showing a Clot and an Obstruction</span><br>
<br>
When a stroke occurs, it kills brain cells in the immediate area because they are no longer receiving the oxygen and nutrients needed to function. <br>
<br>
Brain cells usually die within an hour from the beginning of the stroke. <br>
<br>
Stroke is most common in the elderly, but people of any age and any level of physical fitness can suffer the injury. <br>
<br>
<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/stroke_1.jpg" width="200" height="300" class="floatright">Strokes occur in two main forms: <br>
</span><br>
<span class="bodybold">Cerebral Vascular Accident</span> (CVA) which causes permanent damage to the brain tissue through oxygen starvation (blocked vessel), or pressure (bleeding). There is permanent damage to the brain, resulting in physical and/or sensory impairment</p>
<p><br>
  <span class="bodybold">Transient Ischaemic Attack</span> (TIA) is when the signs of stroke are present but go away within 24 hours. The term TIA is used sometimes referred to as a 'mini stroke', which is a temporary condition usually caused by a minor blockage of the brain's blood vessels. <br>
  <br>
  The blockage lasts long enough to temporarily show the signs and symptoms of a CVA. TIA's may last from several minutes to several hours. <br>
  <br>
  TIA's should be regarded as a warning sign that the person is at risk of a stroke and should be investigated promptly. <br>
  <br>
