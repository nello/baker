<p>The human body maintains a temperature between 36-37ºc. Any excessive variation to this range has a detrimental effect on body functions. As a general observation, it may be said that the human brain does not react well to excessive body heat, and the heart is sensitive to cold. <br>
<br>
The body has some natural defence mechanisms against excessive heat and cold. It regulates body heat by sweating, releasing heat through the body surface (heat loss), and through lung moisture evaporation. Cold is managed by shivering, which generates heat within the body. <br>
<br>
Often, environmental influences determine the stability of the human body's temperature. These influences are important in relation to first aid. Heat and cold related conditions may bring on serious functional impairment. <br>
<br>
<img src="images/heatcold_1.jpg" width="200" height="132" class="floatright">Heat related conditions are those brought on by exposure to high temperatures and humidity. The most spectacular example of a serious heat related problem, is the televised distress suffered by athletes during long distance running events, conducted during hot and humid conditions. <br>
<br>
Heat may induce heat cramps, heat exhaustion and/or heat stroke. Less well known are industrial and engine room situations which can mimic tropical conditions while outside temperatures are actually much lower. <br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold">Dehydration <br>
</span><br>
Dehydration is a condition caused by the casualty's loss of fluids from perspiration and prolonged exposure to heat and humidity. When the casualty's fluid loss exceeds their input through drinking, dehydration occurs and the blood volume lessens. A prolonged period of dehydration will lead to shock and, in susceptible casualties, such as the frail elderly and very young, this can be fatal. <br>

<br>
<span class="bluebold"><img src="images/heatcold_2.jpg" width="195" height="300" class="floatright">Heat cramps <br>
</span><br>
Heat cramps are caused by the loss of complex salts (electrolytes) through an imbalance in the body's fluid requirements – the body is losing more fluids than it is replacing. This debit causes the hardworking muscles to lose their vital electrolyte balance, causing muscular contraction (cramping). <br>

Care and Treatment<br>
<br>
</span><img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> complete rest in the shade, no further exertion <br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> lie casualty down <br>

<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> cool casualty by sponging with water <br>

<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> ensure casualty seeks medical assistance when recovered <br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold">Heat stroke <br>
</span><br>
This condition is not to be confused with 'sun stroke', the common ailment of headache and nausea suffered by children and careless adults who remain in the sun too long without a hat. Also known as 'Core Temperature Emergency', with a core temperature above 40.6ºc heat stroke is potentially life threatening. <br>
<br>
In this condition, the body's temperature regulation centre in the brain has been rendered inoperable, and the body temperature continually rises, causing eventual brain damage. Immediate, active intervention is necessary to avoid coma and death. <br>

<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if unconscious or semi-conscious, nothing by mouth. Re-hydration is required by intravenous fluids administered by a doctor or ambulance crew <br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold"><img src="images/heatcold_3.jpg" width="300" height="200" class="floatright">Exposure to cold <br>
</span><br>
Exposure to cold has effects which are no less serious than exposure to heat and humidity. Remember that an elderly person in an unheated house during winter, who is incapacitated and unable to summon assistance, is at risk from exposure to cold and hypothermia. <br>
<br>
There are several common situations where persons suffer from exposure to low temperatures. This includes being caught out in inclement weather during walking, being soaked in cold water and unable to change, and being subject to cold winds (wind chill) without proper protection, or not being able to afford adequate heating and clothing. <br>
<img src="images/search.png" width="44" height="44" class="search"><br>
<span class="headred">Signs and Symptoms<br>
</span><br>
<img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> pale, cold skin <br>

<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if conscious, give warm, sweet drinks <br>
<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> when able to stand, encourage mild exercise <br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold"><img src="images/heatcold_4.jpg" width="300" height="200" class="floatright">Hypothermia <br>
</span><br>
Hypothermia occurs when the body's control mechanisms fail to maintain a normal body temperature above 35ºc. Hypothermia results from prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. <br>
<br>
Factors that commonly increase the risk of hypothermia include advanced or very young age, substance abuse, impaired mental status, or immersion in cold water. <br>
