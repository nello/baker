<p>Venomous bites and stings are a type of injected poison. Many of Australia's creatures are particularly poisonous, with eleven of the world's twelve most venomous snakes residing here. As for general poisoning, prevention is better than cure, so take care when in an area frequented by snakes and spiders, and treat venomous sea creatures with respect.<br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold"><img src="images/bites_5.jpg" width="300" height="196" class="floatright">Snakes <br>
</span><br>
Australia's venomous snakes are regarded as dangerous because they frequently come in contact with humans. <br>
<br>
Generally, the snakes with the most feared reputation is the variety of Brown Snakes. These snakes, as well as Tiger Snakes, and the Taipan are responsible for most of the fatal encounters with humans. Black Snakes and Death Adders are also dangerous and are known to have caused deaths. Anti-venom is generally available for all species. <br>
<br>
In most cases, the snake strikes swiftly and injects venom below the surface of the skin into the tissues, which is then absorbed by the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network of tubes that drains fluid (lymph) from the body's tissues and  empties it back into the bloodstream. Only rarely does the venom penetrate directly into the blood stream. As the venom is contained within the lymphatic system, the 'John Wayne Method' of slashing the wound and sucking vigorously, is of no value, and should not be used under any circumstances. <br>
<br>
Should you see a snake, LEAVE IT ALONE – <span class="bodybold">DO NOT</span> attempt to kill it as all snakes are protected by law, and besides, the creature will defend itself vigorously. Stay clear of likely habitats, and always pay special attention to young children playing near long grass and bush. Research suggests that only around 15% of people struck by poisonous snakes are envenomated, but always treat for the worst case, and assume that venom has been injected. <br>

The main treatment for a snake bite is the application of a <span class="bodyitalic">'pressure immobilisation bandage'</span>(PIB). A PIB is applied as firmly as bandaging a sprained ankle. Apply a wide crepe bandage (7.5 -10 cm) over the bite site. Apply a second crepe bandage starting from the fingers or toes and winding as far up the limb as possible. Immobilise the limb with a splint. <br>

<span class="bluebold">Spiders <br>
</span><br>
<span class="greenbold"><img src="images/bites_7.jpg" width="300" height="252" class="floatright">Funnel Web Spider <br>
</span><br>
The Sydney Funnel Web spider is considered to be the most venomous spider in the world. It is found in the NSW coastal zone from Nelson's Bay to Nowra. Its habitat is under rocks and houses, in a web-lined burrow. The spider is very aggressive and will attack at the slightest provocation.<br>
<br>
Despite its fearsome reputation, there are only 14 recorded deaths due to funnel web spider bite. However, when the spider does inject a dangerous quantity of venom, the effects can be rapid and severe, and death within an hour may occur. <br>
<br>
A second type of spider called the Bush (or Blue Mountains) Funnel Web is also recorded as being responsible for fatal bites. Its habitat ranges over most of the NSW coast and the Great Dividing Range. This creature lives in trees behind the bark, or in holes in the trunk. Other types of related spiders such as the Northern and Southern Tree Dwelling species, are suspected of similar venom potency, and are found mostly along the south eastern area of Australia. <br>
<br>
There are at least 37 species of funnel web spiders. All are medium to large, robust spiders, mostly dark or black in colour, with stout legs and large fangs. Males search for female mates, a process which may increase the chance of unwanted interaction with people, as they may get underfoot, or into shoes or clothing left on or near the floor. <br>
<br>
The funnel web will bite repeatedly if in contact with the skin, and when bitten by the funnel web spider the venom enters the body similarly to that of snakes. Anti-venom is available. <br>

This spider with the telltale red or orange mark on its thorax is the female of the species. <br>
<br>
The Red-Back spider is common all over Australia, and its preferred habitat is under any old building material, or inside sheds and garages. <br>
<br>
The spider's bite is not generally regarded as fatal, although there are recorded deaths prior to the introduction of the anti-venom. Less than 20% of bites actually result in significant envenomation, but generally, the bite is very painful, and causes distress. <br>

<br>
<span class="greenbold">Other Spiders<br>
</span><br>
Other spiders that have been associated with venomous bites are the White-Tailed Spider, Trapdoor Spider and Wolf Spider. The bite of these spiders causes tissue necrosis, the death of the tissue around the bitten area. A doctor should treat bites from these spiders and assess the bitten area over a period of time to observe for any detrimental effects. <br>
<br>
<span class="bluebold">Ticks <br>
</span><br>
Only the Australian paralysis tick or 'scrub tick' causes envenomation in humans. Ticks are capable of spreading diseases eg Scrub Typhus. Ticks can be found anywhere on the body, but hairy areas, skin clefts and crevices should be examined carefully. <br>

This introduced insect has been associated with some deaths. The European Wasp is coloured yellow and black, with stripes similar to those of a bee. The yellow stripes are brighter in colour than those on a bee, and the insect is slightly larger. <br>
<br>
The insect is attracted to aromatic or sweet tasting things, and will enter food containers such as open soft-drink cans. The creature will then sting when inadvertently handled, and can sting multiple times. Similar to bees, the wasps become aggressive when their nest is disturbed. <br>

<br>
Fire ants nests have no obvious entry or exit holes at the top of the nest. <br>
<br>
A distinguishing feature of fire ants is their aggressive behaviour, particularly near the nest and the variety of sizes within one nest, ranging from 2 – 6 mm. <br>

Many sea creatures are venomous, and the best way to avoid envenomation is to avoid the creatures. As an example, don't pick up or handle creatures washed up on the beach or in rock pools, and don't swim where Box Jellyfish or the Portuguese Man-of-War are prevalent. <br>
<br>
<span class="greenbold"><img src="images/bites_1.jpg" width="280" height="188" class="floatright">Box Jellyfish <br>

The Box Jellyfish, also known as 'Stingers', are prevalent in the north of Australia during the season from November to March. These creatures are deadly, and are responsible for many fatal encounters. <br>

Warning signs at popular beaches should be complied with, and extreme care taken at unpatrolled locations. Respect local knowledge. <br>

<span class="greenbold">'Irukandji Syndrome'<br>
</span><br>
Irukandji syndrome is caused by Irukandji jellyfish such as the Carukia barnesi, and are small, transparent jellyfish about 25 mm across the body or 'bell' with a single tentacle from each corner of its box-shaped body. Irukandji jellyfish are found along coastal beaches as well as offshore and appear to be restricted to waters between the Tropic of Capricorn and the northern tip of Torres Strait. They are mainly prevalent between November and May each year. <br>

Handle all fish with care, avoiding the spinous areas along the backbone and around the gills. Constant handling of fish may cause skin irritation due to the fluids and secretions of the fish oils. <br>

Bites from animals, especially with sharp pointed teeth, can cause deep puncture wounds that carry germs deep into the tissues of the body. Human bites can also crush the tissues. <br>
<br>
Any bite in which the skin is broken requires prompt first aid. Bite wounds are also prone to infection, such as tetanus, and prompt medical attention is required for all animal bites. <br>

<span class="bluebold">Identification and safety <br>
</span><br>
When someone has been poisoned, it is important to remember a detailed description of the creature which delivered the poison. In the case of snakebite, for example, this can help ensure that the correct anti-venene is given as soon as possible. Otherwise, ask the casualty or witnesses for the details which will identify the culprit. <br>
<br>
A little sensible care can also go a long way. Walking in long grass in thongs, reaching unseen under little-used garden shelving, picking up loosely piled bricks without gardening gloves, fossicking in a dark shed without bothering to turn on a light, or crawling into your sleeping bag which you have left open and unrolled all day – all of these are recipes for a close encounter of the venomous kind. Acting hastily, without thought, can be costly. <br>
<br>
And remember, if you have visitors who aren't familiar with the risks, show them how to act safely in your environment</p>
