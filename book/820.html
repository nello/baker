		<p>Back injuries cost the Australian taxpayer, and commercial and industrial interests, many millions of dollars annually. Initial medical costs, and the cost of prolonged rehabilitation of back injury patients, account for the major proportion of industrial insurance payouts. As well as being an expensive injury, an injured back is painful and debilitating. In most cases, the injury was preventable. <br>
		<br>
		The spinal column is a series of interconnected bones, separated by cartilage shock absorbers. Although the spine is flexible, it is not designed to withstand abnormal flexion under load. Lifting weights and carrying loads are normal functions for active humans, however, care must be taken not to exceed the ability of the spine to adequately support this physical activity. When this ability is exceeded, the resultant failure of the spine causes acute and chronic pain, and a reduced capacity to function normally. <br>
		<br>
		It is in everybody's interest, whether employer, employee, or individual, to avoid back injuries by simply 'thinking before lifting'. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold"><img src="images/manual_1.jpg" width="161" height="300" class="floatright">Factors associated with back injury <br>
		</span><br>
		<span class="bodybold">Occupational.</span> Constant manual handling, frequent bending and flexing of the spine, a poor ergonomic workplace, repetitive back movements, all provide a basis for acute injury or chronic complaint. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Personal.</span> Individual strength, age, posture, and degree of fitness are important factors. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Medical/Historical.</span> Previous back complaints, evidence of scoliosis or similar medical conditions, and previous education in back care procedures, will generally, in conjunction with personal factors, dictate the degree of abuse the back can absorb. <br>
		<br>
		The ultimate aim in avoiding back injury is <span class="bodyitalic">to identify and eliminate potential risks</span> before any injury is sustained. To do this effectively, individuals should identify, assess and control any risk factors. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Identify</span> risk factors by reviewing past procedures and comparing the injury rates. Observe and analyse any existing or potential problems. Consider any personal medical or physical limitations. Consult other individuals or organisations. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Assess</span> the risks involved: <br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Is manual handling essential? <br>
		<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> What options are available? <br>
		<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Is the right person involved? <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Control</span> any risk by reducing the necessity for manual handling by using alternative means of handling, by maintaining a SAFE work or home environment (no slippery floors or obstructions), and especially by educating all those involved in safe lifting techniques. <br>
		<br>
		When lifting or moving a load, consider not only the weight of the object, but its size and shape, the distance it is to be carried, the height it will have to be lifted, and its position prior to lifting. In fact, does it need lifting or will it be better to push or pull the load? <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold"><img src="images/manual_2.jpg" width="200" height="195" class="floatright">Lifting or moving a load <br>
		</span><br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> consider the load, – size, shape, etc <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> consider need for mechanical or manual assistance <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> position legs apart – one foot level with the load <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> keep back straight, look up <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> bend from the hips, avoid 'twisting' the body <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> tighten the stomach muscles, but don't hold breath <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> BEND THE KNEES <br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/manual_3.jpg" width="200" height="266"><br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> lift with the legs, not the back <br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/manual_4.jpg" width="200" height="266"><br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> keep the load close to the body <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> keep carrying distance short <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> avoid changing grip or 'jerking' the load <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> deposit the load by bending the knees and keeping the back straight (reverse order of lifting) <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if pulling or pushing, let the legs do the work <br>
		<br>
		Pregnant women should take special care when lifting, as their spine adjusts to cater for the physical changes of the body. A pregnant woman's ligaments are also affected by hormonal changes and 'soften' considerably. Any heavily pregnant woman who lifts or carries a heavy, restless, wriggling child is at risk of back injury or worse. </p>
