		<p>Oxygen is a colourless, odourless, tasteless gas that is essential for the body to function properly and to survive. The air that we breathe contains approximately 21% oxygen, and the heart relies on oxygen to pump blood. If not enough oxygen is circulating in the blood, it's difficult for the tissues of the heart to keep pumping. Supplemental oxygen is used to treat medical conditions in which the tissues of the body do not have enough oxygen. <br>
		<br>
		Oxygen is a gas, but when administered as a supplement to normal atmospheric air, may also be considered a medication (or drug) in the way it is delivered. <br>
		<br>

		<span class="subitalic">Oxygen Transport from Lungs to Cells</span><br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">The respiratory system <br>
		</span><br>
		The anatomical features of the respiratory system involve those structures of the body that conduct air from outside the body to the lungs, and those elements that control and facilitate the process. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="greenbold">The Central Nervous System (CNS) <br>
		</span><br>
		The brain and the spinal cord that make up the CNS and are the controlling mechanism. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">The Upper Airway <br>
		</span><br>
		The upper airway consists of those spaces and structures that assist and guide the movement of air from the nose and mouth to the 'wind pipe'. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Nasopharynx.</span> ls the space behind the nose and extends over the roof of the mouth. It is into this cavity that air is initially drawn when a breath is taken and dry air is warmed and moistened prior to its journey to the lungs. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Oropharynx.</span> Is the cavity that extends from the nasal cavity to the hyoid bone above the opening to the 'wind pipe'. This cavity contains the tonsils. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Laryngopharynx.</span> Is the space immediately above the larynx. The Laryngopharynx includes the glottis, the opening between the larynx and the vocal cords. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Larynx.</span> Also known as the 'Adam's apple', is the cartilaginous structure located above the entry to the lower airway and close to the oesophagus, the entry to the stomach. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Lower Airway <br>
		</span><br>
		<span class="bodybold">Trachea.</span> Is a thin-walled tube approximately the same diameter as a garden hose. The trachea extends to the bronchial tree where the airway branches to the lungs. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Bronchi and bronchioles.</span> The trachea branches into the left and right main bronchi, which successively branch into smaller bronchi, much like the structure of the branches of a tree. These smaller bronchi are located within the lobes of the lungs. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Lungs.</span> The two lungs develop at the end of the bronchi, and are contained within a cavity in the chest. The lungs are porous elastic organs that appear similar to a sponge. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Lobes.</span> Each lung is composed of compartments called lobes; the right lung with three lobes, the left, two. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold"> Alveoli.</span> In the extremities of the lobes, groups of respiratory bronchioles terminate in clusters of structures called alveoli. The alveoli are small sacs composed of elastic tissue, covered by a thin membrane. It is through this membrane that gas exchange takes place.<br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/oxygen_2.png" width="500" height="291"><br>
		<span class="subitalic">Oxygen Exchange in the Lungs</span><br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Associated muscles <br>
		</span><br>
		<span class="bodybold">Diaphragm.</span> A long, flat, smooth muscle attached to the lower six ribs, the sternum and the spine. When relaxed it is convex in shape, forming a 'dome' beneath the lungs. When the CNS stimulates the need for inhalation, the diaphragm flattens, enlarging the chest cavity and allowing expansion of the lungs. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Intercostal muscles.</span> The intercostal muscles are the small smooth muscles between the ribs. When contracted, these muscles expand the chest cavity in an outward direction, providing an enlargement of the chest cavity. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Associated blood structures <br>
		</span><br>
		<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/oxygen_3.png" width="200" height="112" class="floatright">Red blood cells.</span> Red blood cells, or erythrocytes, are the most numerous and specialised cells in the body. <br>
		<br>
		Erythrocytes are flexible concave microscopic discs, adapted to produce haemoglobin. <br>
		<br>
		Erythrocytes circulate through the lungs in the alveolar capillaries, collecting oxygen diffused through the membranes of the alveoli. <br>
		<br>
		Haemoglobin is a hormone which attracts and binds oxygen, and to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide. It has a red pigment which gives blood its red colour. When oxygen combines with haemoglobin, it is known as oxyhaemoglobin, and the enriched blood is a bright red colour. As carbon dioxide does not combine with haemoglobin as effectively, the resultant colour of the blood is dark red. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Respiration <br>
		</span><br>
		The physiology (or function) of respiration involves all those anatomical features discussed previously. Respiration can be considered to start with the process of inhalation, or 'breathing in'. <br>
		<br>
		At the start of each breath, our CNS is stimulated to direct the muscular diaphragm below the lungs to contract. As it contracts, or 'flattens', the chest cavity is enlarged. Because at this point the lungs are deflated, the pressure in them is low. As the air outside our body is at atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi, or 100 kPa), it spontaneously moves into the lungs through the oropharynx to 'even up the pressure'. <br>
		<br>
		The air that has been inhaled moves through the upper and lower airways to the membranes of the lungs, into the alveoli. <br>
		<br>
		At this point, the oxygen content of the air is selectively moved through the walls of the alveoli. <br>
		<br>
		Respiration occurs regularly, depending on the body's demands. An adult awake and at rest will generally have a respiratory rate of 14-18 breaths per minute. When the body is under stress, either physical or emotional, the rate rises accordingly, and could be as high as 30 per minute. When deeply asleep, with the body completely at rest, the body's respiratory rate is somewhat slower, eg 10-12 per minute. <br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/oxygen_4.png" width="500" height="282"><br>
		<span class="subitalic">Expiration and Inspiration of the Lungs</span><br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Oxygen therapy <br>
		</span><br>
		Oxygen therapy is a treatment that provides extra oxygen to the tissues of the body through the lungs, and is provided to a casualty as a supplement to normal respiration. Certain injuries and conditions lead to a loss of ability to maintain oxygen to the body at the required level. <br>
		<br>
		Oxygen therapy provides a regulated flow of supplementary oxygen to 'build up' to the necessary level. Oxygen therapy is usually delivered by a face mask, but nasal prongs can also be used. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold"> Face masks.</span> These are adult or child sized plastic disposable items which fit over the casualty's nose, mouth and chin. They are attached to the regulating device outlet by clear plastic tubing. <br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/oxygen_5.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="floatright">Oxygen delivered via a face mask mixes with air drawn in through holes in the body of the mask. Expired air is exhausted through the holes when the casualty exhales. The percentage of oxygen administered depends on the flow rate from the outlet. <br>
		<br>
		The main disadvantages are that the casualty may feel claustrophobic, and that speech is distorted through the mask. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold"> Nasal prongs.</span> These are plastic prongs set within a length of clear plastic tubing, and are designed to fit into the casualty's nostrils. The disadvantage is that a blocked nose, sinusitis, or a cold sometimes negates the benefits and delivers only low concentrations of oxygen. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">100% oxygen <br>
		</span><br>
		100% oxygen is administered to casualties in respiratory arrest or whose unsupported breathing is insufficient to maintain consciousness. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Demand valve devices.</span> 100% oxygen is delivered from the regulating device directly to a demand valve. A firmly fitting, sealed mask is attached to the demand valve. When the casualty breathes, the demand valve is triggered, and a measured amount of 100% oxygen is delivered. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Manually triggered devices.</span> On some mechanical devices, the demand valve can be triggered by an operator and oxygen can be administered to a non-breathing casualty. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Soft bag and mask devices.</span> These devices consist of a soft bag and reservoir attached to a mask. 100% oxygen is delivered into the bag via the reservoir, and the bag is compressed to administer oxygen to the casualty through the mask. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/oxygen_6.jpg" width="400" height="106"></span><br>
		<br>
		The disadvantage of these devices is the care required to continually assess the casualty. It is easy to inflate the casualty's stomach, or worsen chest and lung injuries or conditions. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Suction <br>
		</span><br>
		Suctioning uses a manual or powered vacuum device to remove foreign materials or fluids from the casualty's airway. <br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/oxygen_7.jpg" width="400" height="166"><br>
		<br>
		Problems often occur secondary to prolonged suctioning where secretions and inspired oxygen are removed and could result in the low oxygenation and damage to the soft membranes of the mouth. <br>
		<br>
		Suction catheters come in two main types: <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold"> Yankauer sucker.</span> A one-size rigid plastic tube that is useful in removing large quantities of matter or fluids. Caution should be used with this piece of equipment to avoid damage to the patient's mouth area. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Y-suction catheter.</span> Flexible plastic tubing that comes in various sizes. It is unable to remove large quantities of matter or fluids and it is easily blocked. The advantage is that it is soft and flexible. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Care in the use of oxygen <br>
		</span><br>
		Although oxygen is beneficial, care is essential in administering it. <br>
		<br>
		Due to the skill required to use the above devices, they should be restricted to those providers who are trained and qualified and used in accordance with the level of training. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Oxygen for medical use <br>
		</span><br>
		Medical oxygen is stored under pressure (up to 13,400 kPa) in steel or aluminium cylinders and can be identified using the following features. <br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Australian standard pin index valve for oxygen equipment <br>
		<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> Black cylinder with white collar <br>
		<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> The cylinders should be labelled   '<span class="bodyitalic">Medical Oxygen' </span><br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold"><img src="images/oxygen_8.jpg" width="200" height="218" class="floatright">Common cylinder sizes are: <br>
		</span><br>
		<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> 'B'  – 200 litres when full <br>
		<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> 'C'  – 400-490 litres when full <br>
		<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> 'D' – 1500 litres when full <br>
		<img src="images/a_square.png" width="22" height="22"> 'G'  – 7600 litres when full <br>
		<br>
		Oxygen cylinders from different companies often hold slightly different quantities of gas. The most common sizes for mechanical resuscitators are the 'B' and 'C', and fixed oxygen equipment normally use 'D' size cylinders or larger. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Preparing a cylinder for use <br>
		</span><br>
		A full cylinder should have a plastic stopper inserted in the valve outlet, or if a smaller cylinder, plastic tape wound around the outlet. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">When preparing a cylinder for use: <br>
		</span><br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> check the external condition and colour of the cylinder<br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> check the valve and outlet port, and wipe them clean<br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> remove the plastic stopper or tape,and check for moisture in the outlet port <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> point the cylinder away from you and 'crack' the valve for one second <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> ensure the valve is turned off tightly <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Oxygen delivery <br>
		</span><br>
		The gas is delivered through a valve to a regulating device which reduces the pressure to a safe 390-400 kPa. The oxygen flow is then delivered through a 'yoke' device that fits onto the valve stem of the cylinder. The yoke has fittings that match the valve stem, and has a measuring device attached to control the flow of oxygen. <br>
		<br>
		Flow rates of oxygen are varied by either a fixed flow outlet set between 3-8 litres per minute (lpm), or by an adjustable flow meter that delivers between 1-25 lpm. This is consistent with the requirements for supplementary oxygen therapy. Full flow rates of oxygen are supplied directly to a demand valve in the case of a mechanical resuscitator. <br>
		<br>
		When delivering oxygen via a therapy mask you can expect 30 minutes at 15lpm from a full 'C' cylinder (440 Litres). <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Connecting oxygen equipment <br>
		</span><br>
		When the selected cylinder has been prepared, connect the equipment as follows: <br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> attach the appropriate yoke device, ensuring that the valve fittings correspond to those on the valve stem <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> tighten the locking screw gently with a cylinder spanner (larger cylinders), or 'finger tight' (smaller cylinders) <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> attach appropriate oxygen therapy or mechanical resuscitator devices <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Cylinder storage <br>
		</span><br>
		Store oxygen cylinders carefully in accordance with relevant government regulations. Prior to storing cylinders, you should contact your company or organisation's OH&amp;S representative for direction and advice. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bodybold">Some important points are: <br>
		</span><br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> cylinders should be kept cool, dry and undercover <br>
