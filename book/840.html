		<p>It is important that analgesia is not offered until a full and comprehensive assessment of the casualty is complete. <span class="bodybold">DO NOT</span> use an analgesic if there are any contra-indications. The following pain relief should only be administered by appropriately trained and authorised first aiders. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Advising the casualty <br>
		</span><br>
		Reassure the casualty before offering the analgesic agent. Explain the actions of the analgesic agent, the reason for self-administration and answer any questions asked by the casualty. Demonstrate how to use the facemask or inhaler, especially to children. <br>
		<br>
		It should be emphasised that both Entonox and Penthrane (Methoxyflurane) will minimise or reduce the pain and make it bearable, not remove it totally. Tell the casualty they may initially find the odour of the gas strange, but this will disappear after use. Explain the potential effects of light-headedness and drowsiness are a normal effect of the analgesic. The effects should be evident after one or two minutes. <br>
		<br>
		<span class="bluebold">Application of the equipment <br>
		</span><br>
		<span class="greenbold">Entonox</span><br>
		<br>
		The equipment should be assembled and placed close to the casualty, and the Entonox cylinder valve opened with the valve key. Offer the handpiece to the casualty, and encourage them to apply the facemask over the face to create a good airtight seal. <br>
		<br>
		Tell the casualty to breathe slowly and deeply for maximum benefit. If the casualty has trouble regulating their breathing, reassure them and encourage normal breathing patterns. <br>
		<br>
		If the casualty displays anxiety at using the inhaler or mask, the mask should be removed and the casualty reassured and the process reiterated before trying again. Should the casualty still refuse or baulk at the process, remove it completely and attempt other treatment. <br>
		<br>
		Ensure that the casualty is told to expect 'clicking' or similar noises from the regulator as normal, and that if this sound is heard it means that the equipment is functioning correctly. <br>

		<span class="greenbold">Penthrox™ Inhaler <br>
		</span><br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if available connect 3lpm or 8lpm of oxygen to the nipple in the base cap <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> open the 3ml bottle of Methoxyflurane, or <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> withdraw 3ml or 6ml of Methoxyflurane from the 125ml bottle using a glass syringe fitted with a stainless steel needle <br>

		<br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> to prime the wick, hold the Penthrox™ Inhaler on a slight angle to the vertical and slowly pour 3ml of Methoxyflurane onto the flat plate of the cap at the base of the nipple<br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if required a further 3ml may be added<br>
		<img src="images/a_arrow.png" width="22" height="22"> maximum dose per patient is 6ml/day or 15ml/week <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> shake lightly to disperse the Methoxyflurane <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> explain the effect of inhaling Methoxyflurane vapour to the patient. Note the fruity smell. Aim for relief of discomfort rather than the total abolition of pain<br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if desired, gently fasten the tapes of the Penthrox™ Inhaler around the patient's wrist <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> the patient places the mouthpiece of the Penthrox™ Inhaler in the mouth. With the diluter hole uncovered, air or oxygen is drawn in through the Methoxyflurane impregnated wick. Exhale through the nose <br>

		<img src="images/advanced_1.jpg" width="300" height="289"><br>
		<br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> after 8-10 breaths the diluter hole can be covered by the patient's index finger to provide a higher concentration of vapour if required <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if the patient prefers simultaneous inhalation through both nose and mouth,fit the shoulder adjacent to the mouth piece into a standard anaesthetic facemask. This is then handed to the patient for self-administration as described above <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> instruct the patient to use the Penthrox™ Inhaler intermittently but sufficient to maintain adequate analgesia.This avoids early exhaustion of the charge, ineffective analgesia or undesired deepening effect <br>
		<img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> prolonged bidirectional breathing through the Penthrox™ Inhaler may tend to coat the wick with moisture, causing a decline in delivered vapour concentration <br>
		<br>
		After priming, the Penthrox™ Inhaler can be thrown or lowered to inaccessible patients, providing the patient is able to understand its correct use. </p>
