		<p>Disturbed behaviour may be due to mental illness, or it may be due to a temporary emotional disturbance. Generally, disturbed behaviour may be classified as follows:<br>
		  <br>
		  <span class="bodybold">Psychosis</span> is a mental illness where the person loses touch with reality. Some forms are well known, with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and paranoia, being the most commonly associated forms.<br>
		  <br>
		  <span class="bodybold">Neurosis</span> is usually a chronic condition where the person remains in touch with reality. The person may have an uncontrollable compunction to act in a particular way, with phobias (fears), obsessions and compulsions the most common neuroses. Anorexia nervosa and excessive anxiety are examples of neurosis.<br>
		  <br>
		  <span class="bodybold">Transient Aberrant Behaviour</span> is a minor condition of temporary mental instability due to a particular emotional or physiological condition. Premenstrual tension, post-natal depression, inappropriate reactions to emotional stress, are all common aberrant behaviour conditions which last only temporarily.<br>
		  <br>
		  It is important to remember that mental illness is just that; <span class="bodybolditalic">an illness</span>. Similar to other illnesses like diabetes and heart disease, mental illness has a regimen of treatment that is designed to ease the symptoms. The mentally ill person, when exhibiting symptoms, cannot help doing or saying things which, to others, appears bizarre and sometimes hurtful. Mental illness is a frightening and debilitating condition, and those who suffer it deserve our help and understanding, not our pity. Sufferers may also mask their symptoms.<br>
		<br>
		It is also important to note that people with a psychosis or neurosis don’t always exhibit symptoms (they are not ‘constantly ill’). They are often active, creative and contributing members of society indistinguishable from other bystanders while medication, counselling and their own positive attitude help them cope. An estimated 20% of the population has some form of ‘mental illness’.<br>

		<span class="bluebold"><img src="images/disturbed_1.jpg" width="266" height="177" class="floatright">Psychosis</span><br>
		  <br>
		  <span class="bodybold">Psychosis</span> is where the psychotic individual is withdrawn from the world that you and I know, and, from the depths of illness, will perceive things differently. If a schizophrenic tells you that they are hearing voices telling them to do certain things, then those voices are real to them!<br>

		<img src="images/cross.png" width="44" height="44" class="cross"><br>
		<span class="headred">Care and Treatment<br>
		  </span><br>
		  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> LISTEN to what is said – remain objective<br>
		  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> look, but don’t stare, at the person when talking<br>
		  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> ask ‘open ended’ questions like, ‘Why do you think that?’<br>
		  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> avoid platitudes; eg ‘You will be all right!’<br>
		  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> keep your voice calm – never shout (they may be confused, but not deaf ). A calm demeanour helps encourage calmness in the affected individual<br>
		  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> always be polite, no matter what provocation is offered<br>
		  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> don’t make sudden moves the person may misconstrue as a threatening gesture<br>
		  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> never laugh AT the person, and don’t tell them YOUR troubles<br>
		  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> if a potentially violent situation is present, don’t get between the psychotic person and the door<br>
		  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> never get into a physical confrontation as you may get hurt<br>
		  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> ask the person if they want help; eg ‘Is there anyone you would like to see or talk to?’<br>
		  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> give them any assistance you can, but don’t make promises you can’t keep<br>
		  <img src="images/a_tick.png" width="22" height="22"> don’t delay in a potentially violent situation and cause risk to the person, to yourself, or to others – GET HELP<br>
		  <br>
		  <span class="bluebold">Neurotic Behaviour<br>
		  </span><br>
		Neurotic Behaviour is a chronic condition, and the first aid provider is more likely to be called on to attend the ‘by products’ of the illness, such as the wounds of a person who self-mutilates, or a person who attempts or threatens suicide as a plea for help.<br>
		<br>
		If called on to assist in a case like this, treat any injuries objectively – don’t comment on the cause. Be sympathetic and provide support as required. Above all, be a good listener! In conversation, the same rules apply as for conversation with a psychotic.<br>
		  <br>
		  <span class="bluebold"><img src="images/disturbed_2.jpg" width="200" height="300" class="floatright">Transient Aberrant Behaviour<br>
		  </span><br>
		  Transient Aberrant Behaviour is a temporary condition, but no less serious. Severe emotional and physiological stress puts intolerable pressure on the affected person, and the resultant outburst has the potential to be violent. Recognition of the onset of stress likely to cause aberrant behaviour is the key to caring for a potential sufferer.<br>
		  <img src="images/search.png" width="44" height="44" class="search"><br>
		  <span class="headred">Signs and Symptoms<br>
		  </span><br>
		  <img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> history of recent emotionally, or physiologically, stressful situation<br>
		  <img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> personality – does the person usually cope easily with stress?<br>
		  <img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> mood swings, emotional outbursts<br>
		  <img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> depression – indifference towards relatives, friends<br>
		  <img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> deterioration in personal appearance<br>
		  <img src="images/a_clipboard.png" width="22" height="22"> increased inattention to family/children<br>
		<br>
		Care for a person presenting with these signs and symptoms is initially support and understanding. Remember that this is a temporary condition, and that this event is not ‘the real individual’. Treatment for the condition is referral to professional psychological help. It may be difficult to persuade the sufferer to attend psychological counselling, but if all else fails, refer them to their own, or a trusted, doctor. Prior to any appointment, contact the doctor and relay your observations. The doctor will appreciate your concern.</p>
