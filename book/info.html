  <span class="bluebold"><img src="images/info_1.jpg" width="271" height="234" class="floatright">About<br>
  </span><br>
  PARASOL was established in Canberra in 1996 by two ambulance intensive care paramedics, who identified a need in the market to provide high-quality, flexible first aid and OHS training solutions for major corporate and government organisations in Australia.<br>
  <br>
  From the outset, our goal was to develop and deliver training solutions that exceeded our customer's expectations.<br>
  <br>
  As demand for our first aid and OHS services grew, so did our presence in Australia's capital cities and major rural centres. An established network of 300 qualified training professionals also guarantees coverage in metropolitan, regional and remote areas.<br>
  <br>
  Currently training 70,000 students annually, PARASOL is committed to being Australia's leading commercial provider of OHS, first aid and advance life support training and products such as our first aid kits.<br>

  <span class="bluebold">FAQs<br>
  </span><br>
  <span class="bodybold">Where did the name PARASOL EMT come from? </span><br>
  <br>
  A combination of Paramedical Solutions &amp; Emergency Medical Training, two companies that merged to form PARASOL EMT in 1996.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">Are your first aid and OH&amp;S courses accredited? </span><br>
  <br>
  Yes, we hold National, Commonwealth, State and Territory approvals or accreditations in a variety of health and safety studies. See our listing on <a href="http://www.ntis.gov.au/?/rto/2551">www.ntis.gov.au/?/rto/2551</a><br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">Do your first aid kits have government approval? </span><br>
  <br>
  In order to build first aid kits you must first submit your kits to TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) whereby the kit will be given an ARTG number.<br>
  <br>
  The listing process requires that you follow guidelines on the contents, labelling and packaging of kits that are set down by TGA.<br>
  <br>
  If a first aid kit supplier who builds their own kits does not abide by this process, then the kit may not meet requirements and/or legislative requirements.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">Where do you conduct courses? <br>
  </span><br>
  We have offices in Adelaide, Albury, Brisbane, Caloundra, Canberra, Mackay, Melbourne, Mildura, Sydney, Tamworth and Wagga Wagga and an extensive national trainer network located in many other regional centres. We conduct on-site training for groups of 10 or more at our client's own premises.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">What sort of clothes should I wear when I attend a training session? <br>
  </span><br>
  Comfortable casual clothing is recommended in order to cope with practical activities.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">Is parking available at your venues? <br>
  </span><br>
  As we have many venues across Australia, you will need to check the parking arrangements for your intended venue. Please refer to the the details on our <a href="http://www.parasolemt.com.au/contact-us/">Contact Us</a> page.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">What are the payment options? <br>
  </span><br>
  Please discuss payment options with your co-ordinator. Due to the high demand for places in our courses, you need to pay prior to the commencement of the training to confirm your place on the course. You will receive a confirmation letter once you have paid.<br>
  In general cancellation fees may apply. However you may be able to transfer to another training course.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">I have special needs; can I still do first aid training? <br>

  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">My certificate has just expired; can I enrol in a re-certification course? <br>
  </span><br>
  No. You must hold in date certification to be able to enrol in a re-certification or refresher course. This applies if your certificate expired 1 week or 1 year ago. Please ensure that you re-certify before your certificate expires.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">How do I enrol in one of your courses? <br>
  </span><br>
  Please contact your nearest office using the details on our contacts page or use the query form.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bodybold">How long are courses accredited for? <br>
